2. License Grants and Conditions
--------------------------------

2.1. Grants

Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive license:

(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
    Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
    as part of a Larger Work; and

(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
    for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
    Contributions or its Contributor Version.

2.2. Effective Date

The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
distributes such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
Contributor:

(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
    or

(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
    Version); or

(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
    its Contributions.

This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
in Section 2.1.

3. Responsibilities
-------------------

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
License(s).

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination
--------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
prior to termination shall survive termination.

*  statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the       *
*  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a        *

8. Litigation
-------------

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous
----------------

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,

If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
create a new license for such software, you may create and use a

such modified license differs from this License).

# data.table [v1.16.4](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/milestone/36) 4 December 2024

## BUG FIXES

1. Joins on multiple columns, such as `x[y, on=c("x1==y1", "x2==y1")]`, could fail during implicit type coercions if `x1` and `x2` had different but still compatible types, [#6602](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/6602). This was particularly unexpected when columns `x1`, `x2`, and `y1` were all of the same class, e.g. `Date`, but differed in their underlying storage types. Thanks to Benjamin Schwendinger for the report and the fix.

# data.table [v1.16.2](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/milestone/35) (9 October 2024)

## BUG FIXES

1. Using `print.data.table()` with character truncation using `datatable.prettyprint.char` no longer errors with `NA` entries, [#6441](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/6441). Thanks to @r2evans for the bug report, and @joshhwuu for the fix.

2. Fixed a segfault in `fcase()`, [#6448](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/6448). Thanks @ethanbsmith for reporting with reprex, @aitap for finding the root cause, and @MichaelChirico for the PR.

3. `fread()` automatically detects timestamps with sub-second accuracy again, [#6440](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/6440). This was a regression due to interference with new `dec='auto'` support. Thanks @kav2k for the concise report and @MichaelChirico for the fix.

4. Using a namespace-qualified call on the RHS of `by=`, e.g. `DT[,.N,by=base::mget(v)]`, works again, fixing [#6493](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/6493). Thanks to @mmoisse for the report and @MichaelChirico for the fix.

5. Restore some join operations on `x` and `i` (e.g. an anti-join `x[!i]`)  where `i` is an extended data.frame, but not a data.table (e.g. a `tbl`), [#6501](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/6501). Thanks @MichaelChirico for the report and PR.

## NOTES

1. Fixed a typo in the NEWS for the last release -- that's version 1.16.0, not 1.6.0; apologies. Thanks @r2evans for flagging, [#6443](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/6443).

2. Continued work to remove non-API C functions, [#6180](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/6180). Thanks Ivan Krylov for the PR and for writing a clear and concise guide about the R API: https://aitap.codeberg.page/R-api/.

3. `data.table` again properly detects OpenMP support when built using `gcc` on macOS, [#6409](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/6409). Thanks @barracuda156 for the report and @kevinushey for the fix.

4. The translations submitted for 1.16.0 are now actually shipped with the package -- our deepest apologies to the translators for the omission. We have added a CI check to ensure that the .mo binaries which get shipped with the package are always up-to-date.

# data.table [v1.16.0](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/milestone/30)  (25 August 2024)

## BREAKING CHANGES

1. `droplevels(in.place=TRUE)` is deprecated in favor of calling `setdroplevels()`, [#6014](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/6014). Given the associated risks/pain points, we strongly prefer all in-place/by-reference behavior within data.table come from functions `set*` (and `:=`) to make it as clear as possible that inputs are mutable. See below and `?setdroplevels` for more.

2. `` `[.data.table` `` is un-exported again. This was exported to support an experimental feature (`DT()` functional form of `[`) that never made it to release, but we forgot to claw back this export in the NAMESPACE; sorry about that. We didn't find anyone calling the method directly (which is inadvisable to begin with).

## NEW FEATURES

1. We continue to consider user feedback to prioritize development. See [#3189](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/3189) for the current list of most-requested issues. In this release we add five highly-requested features:

    a. Using `dt[, names(.SD) := lapply(.SD, fx)]` now works to update all columns, [#795](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/795). Of course this also works when `.SD` is only a subset of the columns: `dt[, names(.SD) := lapply(.SD, fx), .SDcols = is.numeric]`. Thanks to @brodieG for the report, 20 or so others for chiming in, and @ColeMiller1 for PR.

    b. `fread()` now supports automatic detection of `dec` (as either `.` or `,`, the latter being [common in many places in Europe, Africa, and South America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_separator)); this behavior is now the default, i.e. `dec='auto'`, [#2431](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/2431). Thanks @mattdowle for the original issue, 50 or more others for expressing support, and @MichaelChirico for the fix.

    c. `fcase()` supports vectors in `default=` (so the default can vary by row) and `default=` is now lazily evaluated, [#4258](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4258). Thanks @sindribaldur for the feature request, @shrektan for doing most of the implementation, and @MichaelChirico for sewing things up. Thanks also to @DavisVaughan for some design guidance before release to remove an extraneous feature, [#6352](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/6352).

    d. `[.data.table` gains argument `showProgress`, allowing users to toggle progress printing for slow "group by" operations, [#3060](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/3060). The progress bar reports information such as the number of groups processed, total groups, total time elapsed and estimated time until completion. This feature doesn't apply to `GForce`-optimized operations. Thanks to @eatonya and @zachmayer for filing FRs, and to everyone else that up-voted/chimed in on the issue. Thanks to @joshhwuu for the PR.

    e. `rbindlist(l, use.names=TRUE)` and `rbind()` now work correctly on columns with different class attributes across the inputs for certain classes such as `Date`, `IDate`, `ITime`, `POSIXct` and `AsIs` with matched columns of similar classes, e.g., `rbind(data.table(d = Sys.Date()), data.table(d = as.IDate(Sys.Date()-1)))`. The conversion is done automatically and the class attribute of the final column is determined by the first class attribute encountered in the binding list, [#5309](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5309), [#4934](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4934), [#5391](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5391).

    `rbindlist(l, ignore.attr=TRUE)` and `rbind()` also gain argument `ignore.attr` (default `FALSE`) to manually deactivate the safety net preventing binding columns with different column classes, [#3911](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/3911), [#5542](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5542). Thanks to @dcaseykc, @fox34, @adrian-quintario, @berg-michael, @arunsrinivasan, @statquant, @pkress, @jrausch12, @therosko, @OfekShilon, @iMissile, @tdhock for the requests and @ben-schwen for the PR.

2. `print.data.table()` shows empty (`NULL`) list column entries as `[NULL]` for emphasis. Previously they would just print nothing (indistinguishable from an empty string). Part of [#4198](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4198). Thanks @sritchie73 for the proposal and fix.

    ```R
    data.table(a=list(NULL, ""))
    #         a
    #    <list>
    # 1: [NULL]
    # 2:
    ```

3. `.datatable.aware = FALSE` works correctly to signal it's not safe to call data.table methods, [#5654](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5654). Thanks @dvg-p4 for the request and PR. See `vignette("datatable-importing")` for more on this feature.

4. The `split()` method for `data.table`s is more consistent with that for base methods:

   a. `f` can be a formula, [#5392](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5392), mirroring the same in `base::split.data.frame` since R 4.1.0 (May 2021). Thanks to @XiangyunHuang for the request, and @ben-schwen for the PR.

   b. `sep=` is recognized when splitting with `by=`, just like the default and data.frame methods [#5417](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5417). Thanks @MichaelChirico for the request and PR.

5. Namespace-qualifying `data.table::shift()`, `data.table::first()`, or `data.table::last()` will not deactivate GForce, [#5942](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5942). Thanks @MichaelChirico for the proposal and fix. Namespace-qualifying other calls like `stats::sum()`, `base::prod()`, etc., continue to work as an escape valve to avoid GForce, e.g. to ensure S3 method dispatch.

6. `transpose()` gains `list.cols=` argument (default `FALSE`), [#5639](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5639). Use this to return output with list columns and avoid type promotion (an exception is `factor` columns which are promoted to `character` for consistency between `list.cols=TRUE` and `list.cols=FALSE`). This is convenient for creating a row-major representation of a table. Thanks to @MLopez-Ibanez for the request, and @ben-schwen for the PR.

7. `fread()`'s `fill` argument now also accepts an `integer` in addition to boolean values -- an upper bound on the number of columns in the file. `fread` always guesses the number of columns based on reading a sample of rows in the file. When `fill=TRUE`, `fread()` stops reading and ignores subsequent rows when this estimate winds up too low, e.g. when the sampled rows happen to exclude some rows that are even wider, [#2691](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/2691), [#4130](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4130), [#3436](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/3436), [#1812](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/1812) and [#5378](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5378). The suggestion for `fill` to allow a manual estimate of the number of columns instead comes from [#2727](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/2727). Using `fill=Inf` reads the full file for estimating the number of columns. Thanks to @jangorecki, @christellacaze, @Yiguan, @alexdthomas, @ibombonato, @Befrancesco, @TobiasGold for reporting/requesting, and @ben-schwen for the PR.

8. Computations in `j` can return a matrix or array _if it is one-dimensional_, e.g. a row or column vector, when `j` is a list of columns during grouping, [#783](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/783). Previously a matrix could be provided in `DT[, expr, by]` form, but not `DT[, list(expr), by]` form; this resolves that inconsistency. It is still an error to return a "true" array, e.g. a `2x3` matrix.

9. `measure()` helper for `melt()` now supports user-specified `cols` argument, which can be useful to specify a subset of columns to reshape without having to use a regex, [#5063](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5063). Thanks to @UweBlock and @Henrik-P for reporting, and @tdhock for the PR.

10. `setDT()` is faster for data with many columns, thanks @MichaelChirico for reporting and fixing the issue, [#5426](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5426).

11. `dcast()` gains `value.var.in.dots`, `value.var.in.LHSdots` and `value.var.in.RHSdots` arguments, [#5824](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5824). This allows the `value.var` variable(s) in `dcast()` to be represented by `...` in the formula (if not otherwise mentioned). Thanks to @iago-pssjd for the report and PR.

12. `fread()` loads `.bgz` files directly, [#5461](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5461). Thanks to @TMRHarrison for the request with proposed fix, and @ben-schwen for the PR.

13. New `setdroplevels()` as a by-reference version of the `droplevels()` method, which returns a copy of its input, [#6014](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/6014). Thanks @MichaelChirico for the suggestion and implementation.

14. `dcast(fill=NULL)` only computes default fill value if necessary, which eliminates some previous warnings which were potentially confusing (for example, when `fun.aggregate=min` or `max`, warning was "NAs introduced by coercion to integer range"), [#5512](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5512), [#5390](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5390). Thanks to @tdhock for the report and fix.

15. `patterns()` helper for `.SDcols` now accepts arguments `ignore.case`, `perl`, `fixed`, and `useBytes`, which are passed to `grep()`, #5387. Thanks to @iago-pssjd for the feature request, and @tdhock for the implementation.

16. `print()` method for `data.table`s:

    a. Now handles combination multibyte characters correctly when truncating wide string entries, [#5096](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5096). Thanks to @MichaelChirico for the report and @joshhwuu for the fix.

    b. Prints the indicator `---` in every value column when truncation is needed and `row.names = FALSE` instead of adding a blank column where the `rownames` would have been just to include `---`, [#4083](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4083). Thanks @MichaelChirico for the report and @joshhwuu for the fix.

    c. Honors `na.print`, as seen in `print.default`, allowing for string replacement of `NA` values when printing. Thanks @HughParsonage for the report and @joshhwuu for the fix.

    d. Gains new argument `show.indices` (with corresponding option `datatable.show.indices`) that allows the user to print a `data.table`'s indices as columns without having to modify the `data.table` itself. Thanks @MichaelChirico for the report and @joshhwuu for the PR.

    e. Displays `integer64` columns correctly by loading {bit64} if needed, [#6224](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/6224). Thanks @renkun-ken for the report and @MichaelChirico for the fix.

## BUG FIXES

1. `unique()` returns a copy when `nrows(x) <= 1` instead of a mutable alias, [#5932](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/pull/5932). This is consistent with existing `unique()` behavior when the input has no duplicates but more than one row. Thanks to @brookslogan for the report and @dshemetov for the fix.

2. `dcast()` handles coercion of `fill` to `integer64` correctly, [#4561](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4561). Thanks to @emallickhossain for the bug report and @MichaelChirico for the fix.

3. Optimized `shift()` per group produces the right results when simultaneously subsetting, for example, `DT[i==1L, shift(x), by=group]`, [#5962](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5962). Thanks to @renkun-ken for the report and @ben-schwen for the fix.

4. `fwrite(x, row.names=TRUE)` with `x` a `matrix` writes `row.names` when present, not row numbers, [#5315](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5315). Thanks to @Liripo for the report, and @ben-schwen for the fix.

5. Adding a list column to an empty `data.table` works consistently with other column types, [#5738](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5738). Thanks to Benjamin Schwendinger for the report and the fix.

6. In `DT[,j,by]`, `by` retains its attributes (e.g. class) when `j` is GForce optimized, [#5567](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5567). Thanks to @danwwilson for the report, and @ben-schwen for the PR.

7. `dt[,,by=aÃ±o]` (i.e., using a column name containing a non-ASCII character in `by` as a plain symbol) no longer errors with "object 'aÃ±o' not found", #4708. Thanks @pfv07 for the report, and @MichaelChirico for the fix. Also thanks to @aitap for suggesting an improvement to the corresponding test, [#6339](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/6339).

8. Fixed some memory management issues in the C routines backing `melt()`, `froll()`, and GForce `mean()`, as identified by `rchk`. Thanks Tomas Kalibera and the CRAN team for setting up the `rchk` system, and @MichaelChirico for the fix.

9. data.table's `all.equal()` method now dispatches to each column's own `all.equal()` method as appropriate, [#4543](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4543). Thanks @MichaelChirico for the report and fix. Note that this had two noteworthy changes to data.table's own test suite that might affect you:

    1. Comparisons of POSIXct columns compare absolute, not relative differences, meaning that millisecond-scale differences might trigger a "not equal" report that was hidden before.
    2. Comparisons of integer64 columns could be totally wrong since they were being compared on the basis of their representation as doubles, not long integers.

    The former might be a matter of preference requiring you to specify a different `tolerance=`, while the latter was clearly a bug.

10. `rbindlist()` and `shift()` could lead to a protection stack overflow when applied to a list containing many nested lists exceeding the pointer protection stack size, [#4536](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4536). Thanks to @ProfFancyPants for reporting, and @ben-schwen (`rbindlist`) and @MichaelChirico (`shift`) for the fix.

11. `fread(x, colClasses="POSIXct")` now also works for columns containing only `NA` values, [#6208](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/6208). Thanks to @markus-schaffer for the report, and @ben-schwen for the fix.

12. `fread()` is more careful about detecting that a file is compressed in bzip2 format, [#6304](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/6304). In particular, we also check the 4th byte of the file is a digit; in rare cases, a legitimate uncompressed CSV file could match 'BZh' as the first 3 bytes. We think an uncompressed CSV file matching 'BZh[1-9]' is all the more rare and unlikely to be encountered in "real" examples. Other formats (zip, gzip) are friendly enough to use non-printable characters in their magic numbers. Thanks @grainnemcguire for the report and @MichaelChirico for the fix.

13. Selecting the key column like `DT[, .(key1, key2)]` will retain the key without a performance penalty, [#4498](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4498). Thanks to @user9439449 on StackOverflow for the report and @MichaelChirico for the fix.

14. Passing functions programmatically with `env=` doesn't produce an opaque error, e.g. `DT[, f(b), env = list(f=sum)]`, [#6026](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/6026). Note that it's much better to pass functions like `f="sum"` instead. Thanks to @MichaelChirico for the bug report and fix.

## NOTES

1. `transform()` method for data.table sped up substantially when creating new columns on large tables. Thanks to @OfekShilon for the report and PR. The implemented solution was proposed by @ColeMiller1.

2. The documentation for the `fill` argument in `rbind()` and `rbindlist()` now notes the expected behaviour for missing `list` columns when `fill=TRUE`, namely to use `NULL` (not `NA`), [#4198](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/pull/4198). Thanks @sritchie73 for the proposal and fix.

3. data.table now depends on R 3.3.0 (2016) instead of 3.1.0 (2014). Recent versions of R have good features that we would gradually like to incorporate, and we see next to no usage of these very old versions of R. We originally attempted to bump only to R 3.2.0 in this release, but our vignette engine {knitr} requiring 3.3.0 and `R CMD check` lacking an `--ignore-vignettes` option until 3.3.0 essentially forced our hands.

4. Erroneous assignment calls in `[` with a trailing comma (e.g. ``DT[, `:=`(a = 1, b = 2,)]``) get a friendlier error since this situation is common during refactoring and easy to miss visually. Thanks @MichaelChirico for the fix.

5. Input files are now kept open during `mmap()` when running under Emscripten, [emscripten-core/emscripten#20459](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/issues/20459). This avoids an error in `fread()` when running in WebAssembly, [#5969](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5969). Thanks to @maek-ies for the report and @georgestagg for the PR.

6. `dcast()` improves behavior for the situation that the `fun.aggregate` value of `length()` is used but not provided by the user. 

    a. This now triggers a warning, not a message, since relying on this default often signals unexpected duplicates in the data, [#5386](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5386). The warning is classed as `dt_missing_fun_aggregate_warning`, allowing for more targeted handling in user code. Thanks @MichaelChirico for the suggestion and @Nj221102 for the fix.

    b. The warning itself does better explaining the behavior and suggesting alternatives, [#5217](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5217). Thanks @MichaelChirico for the suggestion and @Nj221102 for the fix.

7. Updated a test relying on operator `>` working for comparing language objects to a string, which will be deprecated by R, [#5977](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5977); no user-facing effect. Thanks to R-core for continuously improving the language.

8. Improved OpenMP detection when building from source on Mac, [#4348](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4348). Thanks @jameshester and @kevinushey for the request and @kevinushey for the PR, @jameslamb for the advice and @s-u of R-core for ensuring CRAN machines are configured to support the expected setup.

9. `test.data.table()` runs more robustly:

    a. In sessions where the `digits` or `warn` options are not their defaults (`7` and `0`, respectively), [#5285](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5285). Thanks @OfekShilon for the report and suggested fix and @MichaelChirico for the PR.

    b. In locales where `letters != sort(letters)`, e.g. Latvian, [#3502](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/3502). Thanks @minemR for the report and @MichaelChirico for the fix.

    c. Initialises the numeric rounding value to 0 using `setNumericRounding(0)` to avoid failed tests if the user has set a different value, [#6082](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/6082). The user's value is restored on exit. Thanks to @MichaelChirico for the report and for describing the solution, and @markseeto for implementing.

    To enable this, `setNumericRounding()` now invisibly returns the old rounding value instead of `NULL`, which is consistent with similar behavior by `setwd()`, `options()`, etc. Thanks @MichaelChirico for the report and @joshhwuu for the fix.

10. The `measure()` and `patterns()` helpers for `[` and `melt()` are now exported to ensure consistency with other non-standard evaluation (NSE) exports like `.N` and `:=`. This change addresses [#5604](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5604), allowing package developers to import these names and avoid `R CMD check` `NOTE`s about undefined variables. Thanks to @MichaelChirico and @ylelkes for their suggestions, and to @Nj221102 for the implementation.

    We plan to export similar placeholders for `.` and `J` in roughly one year (e.g. data.table 1.18.0), but excluded them from this release to avoid back-compatibility issues. Specifically, some packages doing `import(plyr)` _and_ `import(data.table)`, and/or with those packages in `Depends`, will error when data.table starts exporting `.` (and similarly for a potential conflict with `rJava::J()`). We discourage using data.table (or any package, really) in Depends; blanket `import()` of package is also generally best avoided. See `vignette("datatable-importing")`.

11. `fwrite()` header rows are no longer quoted automatically when `na` argument is given, [#2964](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/2964). Thanks @jangorecki for the report and @joshhwuu for the fix.

12. Removed a warning about the now totally-obsolete option `datatable.CJ.names`, as discussed in previous releases.

13. Refactored some non-API calls in the package C code, [#6180](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/6180). There should be no user-visible change. Thanks to various R users, R core, and especially Luke Tierney for pushing to have a clearer definition of "API" for R and for offering clear documentation and suggested workarounds. Thanks @MichaelChirico and @TysonStanley for implementing changes for this release; more will follow.

14. C code is more unified in how failures to allocate memory (`malloc()`/`calloc()`) are handled, [#1115](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/1115). No OOM issues were reported, as these regions of code typically request relatively small blocks of memory, but it is good to handle memory pressure consistently. Thanks @elfring for the report and @MichaelChirico for the clean-up effort and future-proofing linter.

15. The internal routine for finding sort order (`forder()`) will now re-use any existing index. A similar optimization was already present in R code, but this has now been pushed to C and covers a wider range of use cases and collects more statistics about its input (e.g. whether any infinite entries were found), opening the possibility for more optimizations in other functions.

    Functions `setindex()` (and `setindexv()`) will now compute groups' positions as well. `setindex()` also collects the extra statistics alluded to above.

    Finding sort order in other routines (for example subset `d2[id==1L]`) does not include those extra statistics so as not to impose a slowdown.

    ```r
     d2 = data.table(id=2:1, v2=1:2)
    setindexv(d2, "id")
    str(attr(attr(d2, "index"), "__id"))
     # int [1:2] 2 1
    # - attr(*, "starts")= int [1:2] 1 2
    # - attr(*, "maxgrpn")= int 1
    # - attr(*, "anyna")= int 0
    # - attr(*, "anyinfnan")= int 0
    # - attr(*, "anynotascii")= int 0
    # - attr(*, "anynotutf8")= int 0

    d2 = data.table(id=2:1, v2=1:2)
    invisible(d2[id==1L])
    str(attr(attr(d2, "index"), "__id"))
    # int [1:2] 2 1
    ```

    This feature also enables re-use of sort index during joins, in cases where one of the calls to find sort order is made from C code.

    ```r
    d1 = data.table(id=1:2, v1=1:2)
    d2 = data.table(id=2:1, v2=1:2)
    setindexv(d2, "id")
    d1[d2, on="id", verbose=TRUE]
    #...
    #Starting bmerge ...
    #forderReuseSorting: using existing index: __id
    #forderReuseSorting: opt=2, took 0.000s
    #...
    ```

    This feature resolves [#4387](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4387), [#2947](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/2947), [#4380](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4380), and [#1321](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/1321). Thanks to @jangorecki, @jan-glx, and @MichaelChirico for the reports and @jangorecki for implementing.

16. `set()` now adds new columns even if no rows are updated, [#5409](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5409). This behavior is now consistent with `:=`, thanks to @mb706 for the report and @joshhwuu for the fix.

17. The internal `init()` function in the `fread.c` module has been marked as `static`, [#6328](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/pull/6328). This obviates name collisions, and the resulting segfaults, with other libraries visible to the R process that might expose the same symbol name. This was observed in Cray HPE environments where the `libsci` library providing LAPACK to R already has an `init` symbol. Thanks to @rtobar for the report and fix.

18. `?melt` has long documented that the returned `variable` column should contain integer column indices when `measure.vars` is a list, but when the list length is 1, `variable` is actually a character column name, which is inconsistent with the documentation, [#5209](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5209). To increase consistency in the next release, we plan to change `variable` to integer, so users who were relying on this behavior should change `measure.vars=list("col_name")` (`variable` currently is a column name but will be a column index/integer after this planned change) to `measure.vars="col_name"` (`variable` is column name before and after the planned change). For now, relying on this undocumented behavior throws a new warning.

19. `?dcast` has always required `fun.aggregate` to return a single value, and when `fill=NULL`, `dcast` would indeed error if a vector with `length!=1` was returned, but an undefined result was silently returned for non-`NULL` fill. Now `dcast()` will additionally warn that this is undefined behavior when fill is not `NULL`, [#6032](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/6032). In particular, this will warn for `fun.aggregate=identity`, which was observed in several revdeps. We may change this to an error in a future release, so revdeps should fix their code as soon as possible. Thanks to @tdhock for the PR, and @MichaelChirico for analysis of GitHub revdeps.

## TRANSLATIONS

1. Fix a typo in a Mandarin translation of an error message that was hiding the actual error message, [#6172](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/6172). Thanks @trafficfan for the report and @MichaelChirico for the fix.

2. data.table is now translated into Brazilian Portuguese ([`pt_BR`](https://github.com/orgs/Rdatatable/teams/brazil)) and Spanish ([`es`](https://github.com/orgs/Rdatatable/teams/spanish)) as well as Mandarin (`zh_CN`). Thanks to the new translation teams consisting initially of @rffontenelle, @leofontenelle, and @italo-07 for Portuguese; and @rikivallalba, @rivaquiroga, and @MaraDestefanis for Spanish. The teams are open if you'd also like to join and support maintenance of these translations.

3. A more helpful error message for using `:=` inside the first argument (`i`) of `[.data.table` is now available in translation, [#6293](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/6293). Previously, the code to display this assumed an earlier message was printed in English. The solution is for calling `:=` directly (i.e., outside the second argument `j` of `[.data.table`) to throw an error of class `dt_invalid_let_error`. Thanks to Spanish translator @rikivillalba for spotting the issue and @MichaelChirico for the fix.

# data.table [v1.15.4](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/milestone/33) (27 March 2024)

## BUG FIXES

1. Optimized `shift` per group produced wrong results when simultaneously subsetting, for example, `DT[i==1L, shift(x), by=group]`, [#5962](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5962). Thanks to @renkun-ken for the report and Benjamin Schwendinger for the fix.

## NOTES

1. Updated a test relying on `>` working for comparing language objects to a string, which will be deprecated by R, [#5977](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5977); no user-facing effect. Thanks to R-core for continuously improving the language.

# data.table [v1.15.2](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/milestone/32) (27 Feb 2024)

## BUG FIXES

1. An error in `fwrite()` is more robust across platforms -- CRAN found the use of `PRId64` does not always match the output of `xlength()`, e.g. on some Mac M1 builds [#5935](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5935). Thanks CRAN for identifying the issue and @ben-schwen for the fix.

2. `shift()` of a vector in grouped queries (under GForce) returns a vector, consistent with `shift()` in other contexts, [#5939](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5939). Thanks @shrektan for the report and @MichaelChirico for the fix.

# data.table [v1.15.0](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/milestone/29)  (30 Jan 2024)

## BREAKING CHANGE

1. `shift` and `nafill` will now raise error `input must not be matrix or array` when `matrix` or `array` is provided on input, rather than giving useless result, [#5287](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5287). Thanks to @ethanbsmith for reporting.

## NEW FEATURES

1. `nafill()` now applies `fill=` to the front/back of the vector when `type="locf|nocb"`, [#3594](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/3594). Thanks to @ben519 for the feature request. It also now returns a named object based on the input names. Note that if you are considering joining and then using `nafill(...,type='locf|nocb')` afterwards, please review `roll=`/`rollends=` which should achieve the same result in one step more efficiently. `nafill()` is for when filling-while-joining (i.e. `roll=`/`rollends=`/`nomatch=`) cannot be applied.

2. `mean(na.rm=TRUE)` by group is now GForce optimized, [#4849](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4849). Thanks to the [h2oai/db-benchmark](https://github.com/h2oai/db-benchmark) project for spotting this issue. The 1 billion row example in the issue shows 48s reduced to 14s. The optimization also applies to type `integer64` resulting in a difference to the `bit64::mean.integer64` method: `data.table` returns a `double` result whereas `bit64` rounds the mean to the nearest integer.

3. `fwrite()` now writes UTF-8 or native csv files by specifying the `encoding=` argument, [#1770](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/pull/1770). Thanks to @shrektan for the request and the PR.

4. `data.table()` no longer fills empty vectors with `NA` with warning. Instead a 0-row `data.table` is returned, [#3727](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/3727). Since `data.table()` is used internally by `.()`, this brings the following examples in line with expectations in most cases. Thanks to @shrektan for the suggestion and PR.

    ```R
    DT = data.table(A=1:3, B=letters[1:3])
    DT[A>3,   .(ITEM='A>3', A, B)]  # (1)
    DT[A>3][, .(ITEM='A>3', A, B)]  # (2)
    # the above are now equivalent as expected and return:
    Empty data.table (0 rows and 3 cols): ITEM,A,B
    # Previously, (2) returned :
          ITEM     A      B
       <char> <int> <char>
    1:    A>3    NA   <NA>
    Warning messages:
    1: In as.data.table.list(jval, .named = NULL) :
      Item 2 has 0 rows but longest item has 1; filled with NA
    2: In as.data.table.list(jval, .named = NULL) :
      Item 3 has 0 rows but longest item has 1; filled with NA
    ```

    ```R
    DT = data.table(A=1:3, B=letters[1:3], key="A")
    DT[.(1:3, double()), B]
    # new result :
    character(0)
    # old result :
    [1] "a" "b" "c"
    Warning message:
    In as.data.table.list(i) :
      Item 2 has 0 rows but longest item has 3; filled with NA
    ```

5. `%like%` on factors with a large number of levels is now faster, [#4748](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4748). The example in the PR shows 2.37s reduced to 0.86s on a factor length 100 million containing 1 million unique 10-character strings. Thanks to @statquant for reporting, and @shrektan for implementing.

6. `keyby=` now accepts `TRUE`/`FALSE` together with `by=`, [#4307](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4307). The primary motivation is benchmarking where `by=` vs `keyby=` is varied across a set of queries. Thanks to Jan Gorecki for the request and the PR.

    ```R
    DT[, sum(colB), keyby="colA"]
    DT[, sum(colB), by="colA", keyby=TRUE]   # same
    ```

7. `fwrite()` gains a new `datatable.fwrite.sep` option to change the default separator, still `","` by default. Thanks to Tony Fischetti for the PR. As is good practice in R in general, we usually resist new global options for the reason that a user changing the option for their own code can inadvertently change the behaviour of any package using `data.table` too. However, in this case, the global option affects file output rather than code behaviour. In fact, the very reason the user may wish to change the default separator is that they know a different separator is more appropriate for their data being passed to the package using `fwrite` but cannot otherwise change the `fwrite` call within that package.

8. `melt()` now supports `NA` entries when specifying a list of `measure.vars`, which translate into runs of missing values in the output. Useful for melting wide data with some missing columns, [#4027](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4027). Thanks to @vspinu for reporting, and @tdhock for implementing.

9. `melt()` now supports multiple output variable columns via the `variable_table` attribute of `measure.vars`, [#3396](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/3396) [#2575](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/2575) [#2551](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/2551), [#4998](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4998). It should be a `data.table` with one row that describes each element of the `measure.vars` vector(s). These data/columns are copied to the output instead of the usual variable column. This is backwards compatible since the previous behavior (one output variable column) is used when there is no `variable_table`. New functions `measure()` and `measurev()` which use either a separator or a regex to create a `measure.vars` list/vector with `variable_table` attribute; useful for melting data that has several distinct pieces of information encoded in each column name. See new `?measure` and new section in reshape vignette. Thanks to Matthias Gomolka, Ananda Mahto, Hugh Parsonage, Mark Fairbanks for reporting, and to Toby Dylan Hocking for implementing. Thanks to @keatingw for testing before release, requesting `measure()` accept single groups too [#5065](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5065), and Toby for implementing.

10. A new interface for _programming on data.table_ has been added, closing [#2655](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/2655) and many other linked issues. It is built using base R's `substitute`-like interface via a new `env` argument to `[.data.table`. For details see the new vignette *programming on data.table*, and the new `?substitute2` manual page. Thanks to numerous users for filing requests, and Jan Gorecki for implementing.

    ```R
    DT = data.table(x = 1:5, y = 5:1)

    # parameters
    in_col_name = "x"
    fun = "sum"
    fun_arg1 = "na.rm"
    fun_arg1val = TRUE
    out_col_name = "sum_x"

    # parameterized query
    #DT[, .(out_col_name = fun(in_col_name, fun_arg1=fun_arg1val))]

    # desired query
    DT[, .(sum_x = sum(x, na.rm=TRUE))]

    # new interface
    DT[, .(out_col_name = fun(in_col_name, fun_arg1=fun_arg1val)),
      env = list(
        in_col_name = "x",
        fun = "sum",
        fun_arg1 = "na.rm",
        fun_arg1val = TRUE,
        out_col_name = "sum_x"
      )]
    ```

11. `DT[, if (...) .(a=1L) else .(a=1L, b=2L), by=group]` now returns a 1-column result with warning `j may not evaluate to the same number of columns for each group`, rather than error `'names' attribute [2] must be the same length as the vector`, [#4274](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4274). Thanks to @robitalec for reporting, and Michael Chirico for the PR.

12. Typo checking in `i` available since 1.11.4 is extended to work in non-English sessions, [#4989](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4989). Thanks to Michael Chirico for the PR.

13. `fifelse()` now coerces logical `NA` to other types and the `na` argument supports vectorized input, [#4277](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4277) [#4286](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4286) [#4287](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4287). Thanks to @michaelchirico and @shrektan for reporting, and @shrektan for implementing.

14. `.datatable.aware` is now recognized in the calling environment in addition to the namespace of the calling package, [dtplyr#184](https://github.com/tidyverse/dtplyr/issues/184). Thanks to Hadley Wickham for the idea and PR.

15. New convenience function `%plike%` maps to `like(..., perl=TRUE)`, [#3702](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/3702). `%plike%` uses Perl-compatible regular expressions (PCRE) which extend TRE, and may be more efficient in some cases. Thanks @KyleHaynes for the suggestion and PR.

16. `fwrite()` now accepts `sep=""`, [#4817](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4817). The motivation is an example where the result of `paste0()` needs to be written to file but `paste0()` takes 40 minutes due to constructing a very large number of unique long strings in R's global character cache. Allowing `fwrite(, sep="")` avoids the `paste0` and saves 40 mins. Thanks to Jan Gorecki for the request, and Ben Schwen for the PR.

17. `data.table` printing now supports customizable methods for both columns and list column row items, part of [#1523](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/1523). `format_col` is S3-generic for customizing how to print whole columns and by default defers to the S3 `format` method for the column's class if one exists; e.g. `format.sfc` for geometry columns from the `sf` package, [#2273](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/2273). Similarly, `format_list_item` is S3-generic for customizing how to print each row of list columns (which lack a format method at a column level) and also by default defers to the S3 `format` method for that item's class if one exists. Thanks to @mllg who initially filed [#3338](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/pulls/3338) with the seed of the idea, @franknarf1 who earlier suggested the idea of providing custom formatters, @fparages who submitted a patch to improve the printing of timezones for [#2842](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/2842), @RichardRedding for pointing out an error relating to printing wide `expression` columns in [#3011](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/3011), @JoshOBrien for improving the output for geometry columns, and @MichaelChirico for implementing. See `?print.data.table` for examples.

18. `tstrsplit(,type.convert=)` now accepts a named list of functions to apply to each part, [#5094](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5094). Thanks to @Kamgang-B for the request and implementing.

19. `as.data.table(DF, keep.rownames=key='keyCol')` now works, [#4468](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4468). Thanks to Michael Chirico for the idea and the PR.

20. `dcast()` now supports complex values in `value.var`, [#4855](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4855). This extends earlier support for complex values in `formula`. Thanks Elio Campitelli for the request, and Michael Chirico for the PR.

21. `melt()` was pseudo generic in that `melt(DT)` would dispatch to the `melt.data.table` method but `melt(not-DT)` would explicitly redirect to `reshape2`. Now `melt()` is standard generic so that methods can be developed in other packages, [#4864](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/pull/4864). Thanks to @odelmarcelle for suggesting and implementing.


22. `DT[i, nomatch=NULL]` where `i` contains row numbers now excludes `NA` and any outside the range [1,nrow], [#3109](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/3109) [#3666](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/3666). Before, `NA` rows were returned always for such values; i.e. `nomatch=0|NULL` was ignored. Thanks Michel Lang and Hadley Wickham for the requests, and Jan Gorecki for the PR. Using `nomatch=0` in this case when `i` is row numbers generates the warning `Please use nomatch=NULL instead of nomatch=0; see news item 5 in v1.12.0 (Jan 2019)`.

    ```R
    DT = data.table(A=1:3)
    DT[c(1L, NA, 3L, 5L)]  # default nomatch=NA
    #        A
    #    <int>
    # 1:     1
    # 2:    NA
    # 3:     3
    # 4:    NA
    DT[c(1L, NA, 3L, 5L), nomatch=NULL]
    #        A
    #    <int>
    # 1:     1
    # 2:     3
    ```

23. `DT[, head(.SD,n), by=grp]` and `tail` are now optimized when `n>1`, [#5060](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5060) [#523](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/523#issuecomment-162934391). `n==1` was already optimized. Thanks to Jan Gorecki and Michael Young for requesting, and Benjamin Schwendinger for the PR.

24. `setcolorder()` gains `before=` and `after=`, [#4358](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4358). Thanks to Matthias Gomolka for the request, and both Benjamin Schwendinger and Xianghui Dong for implementing. Also thanks to Manuel LÃ³pez-IbÃ¡Ã±ez for testing dev and mentioning needed documentation before release.

25. `base::droplevels()` gains a fast method for `data.table`, [#647](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/647). Thanks to Steve Lianoglou for requesting, Boniface Kamgang and Martin Binder for testing, and Jan Gorecki and Benjamin Schwendinger for the PR. `fdroplevels()` for use on vectors has also been added.

26. `shift()` now also supports `type="cyclic"`, [#4451](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4451). Arguments that are normally pushed out by `type="lag"` or `type="lead"` are re-introduced at this type at the first/last positions. Thanks to @RicoDiel for requesting, and Benjamin Schwendinger for the PR.

    ```R
    # Usage
    shift(1:5, n=-1:1, type="cyclic")
    # [[1]]
    # [1] 2 3 4 5 1
    #
    # [[2]]
    # [1] 1 2 3 4 5
    #
    # [[3]]
    # [1] 5 1 2 3 4

    # Benchmark
    x = sample(1e9) # 3.7 GB
    microbenchmark::microbenchmark(
      shift(x, 1, type="cyclic"),
      c(tail(x, 1), head(x,-1)),
      times = 10L,
      unit = "s"
    )
    # Unit: seconds
    #                          expr  min   lq mean  median   uq  max neval
    #  shift(x, 1, type = "cyclic") 1.57 1.67 1.71    1.68 1.70 2.03    10
    #    c(tail(x, 1), head(x, -1)) 6.96 7.16 7.49    7.32 7.64 8.60    10
    ```

27. `fread()` now supports "0" and "1" in `na.strings`, [#2927](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/2927). Previously this was not permitted since "0" and "1" can be recognized as boolean values. Note that it is still not permitted to use "0" and "1" in `na.strings` in combination with `logical01 = TRUE`. Thanks to @msgoussi for the request, and Benjamin Schwendinger for the PR.

28. `setkey()` now supports type `raw` as value columns (not as key columns), [#5100](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5100). Thanks Hugh Parsonage for requesting, and Benjamin Schwendinger for the PR.

29. `shift()` is now optimized by group, [#1534](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/1534). Thanks to Gerhard Nachtmann for requesting, and Benjamin Schwendinger for the PR. Thanks to @neovom for testing dev and filing a bug report, [#5547](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5547) which was fixed before release. This helped also in improving the logic for when to turn on optimization by group in general, making it more robust.

    ```R
    N = 1e7
    DT = data.table(x=sample(N), y=sample(1e6,N,TRUE))
    shift_no_opt = shift  # different name not optimized as a way to compare
    microbenchmark(
      DT[, c(NA, head(x,-1)), y],
      DT[, shift_no_opt(x, 1, type="lag"), y],
      DT[, shift(x, 1, type="lag"), y],
      times=10L, unit="s")
    # Unit: seconds
    #                                       expr     min      lq    mean  median      uq     max neval
    #                DT[, c(NA, head(x, -1)), y]  8.7620  9.0240  9.1870  9.2800  9.3700  9.4110    10
    #  DT[, shift_no_opt(x, 1, type = "lag"), y] 20.5500 20.9000 21.1600 21.3200 21.4400 21.5200    10
    #         DT[, shift(x, 1, type = "lag"), y]  0.4865  0.5238  0.5463  0.5446  0.5725  0.5982    10
    ```

    Example from [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35179911/shift-in-data-table-v1-9-6-is-slow-for-many-groups)
    ```R
    set.seed(1)
    mg = data.table(expand.grid(year=2012:2016, id=1:1000),
                    value=rnorm(5000))
    microbenchmark(v1.9.4  = mg[, c(value[-1], NA), by=id],
                   v1.9.6  = mg[, shift_no_opt(value, n=1, type="lead"), by=id],
                   v1.14.4 = mg[, shift(value, n=1, type="lead"), by=id],
                   unit="ms")
    # Unit: milliseconds

    ```

30. `rbind()` and `rbindlist()` now support `fill=TRUE` with `use.names=FALSE` instead of issuing the warning `use.names= cannot be FALSE when fill is TRUE. Setting use.names=TRUE.`, [#5444](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5444). Thanks to @sindribaldur, @dcaseykc, @fox34, @adrian-quintario and @berg-michael for testing dev and filing a bug report which was fixed before release.

    ```R
    DT1
    #        A     B
    #    <int> <int>
    # 1:     1     5
    # 2:     2     6

    DT2
    #      foo
    #    <int>
    # 1:     3
    # 2:     4

    rbind(DT1, DT2, fill=TRUE)   # no change
    #        A     B   foo
    #    <int> <int> <int>
    # 1:     1     5    NA

    # 3:    NA    NA     3
    # 4:    NA    NA     4

    rbind(DT1, DT2, fill=TRUE, use.names=FALSE)

    # was:

    # 3:    NA    NA     3
    # 4:    NA    NA     4
    # Warning message:
    # In rbindlist(l, use.names, fill, idcol) :

    # 2:     2     6
    # 3:     3    NA
    # 4:     4    NA
    ```

31. `fread()` already made a good guess as to whether column names are present by comparing the type of the fields in row 1 to the type of the fields in the sample. This guess is now improved when a column contains a string in row 1 (i.e. a potential column name) but all blank in the sample rows, [#2526](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/2526). Thanks @st-pasha for reporting, and @ben-schwen for the PR.

32. `fread()` can now read `.zip` and `.tar` directly, [#3834](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/3834). Moreover, if a compressed file name is missing its extension, `fread()` now attempts to infer the correct filetype from its magic bytes. Thanks to Michael Chirico for the idea, and Benjamin Schwendinger for the PR.

33. `DT[, let(...)]` is a new alias for the functional form of `:=`; i.e. `DT[, ':='(...)]`, [#3795](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/3795). Thanks to Elio Campitelli for requesting, and Benjamin Schwendinger for the PR.

    ```R
    DT = data.table(A=1:2)
    DT[, let(B=3:4, C=letters[1:2])]
    DT
    #        A     B      C
    #    <int> <int> <char>
    # 1:     1     3      a
    # 2:     2     4      b
    ```

34. `weighted.mean()` is now optimized by group, [#3977](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/3977). Thanks to @renkun-ken for requesting, and Benjamin Schwendinger for the PR.

35. `as.xts.data.table()` now supports non-numeric xts coredata matrixes, [5268](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5268). Existing numeric only functionality is supported by a new `numeric.only` parameter, which defaults to `TRUE` for backward compatibility and the most common use case. To convert non-numeric columns, set this parameter to `FALSE`. Conversions of `data.table` columns to a `matrix` now uses `data.table::as.matrix`, with all its performance benefits. Thanks to @ethanbsmith for the report and fix.

36. `unique.data.table()` gains `cols` to specify a subset of columns to include in the resulting `data.table`, [#5243](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5243). This saves the memory overhead of subsetting unneeded columns, and provides a cleaner API for a common operation previously needing more convoluted code. Thanks to @MichaelChirico for the suggestion & implementation.

37. `:=` is now optimized by group, [#1414](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/1414). Thanks to Arun Srinivasan for suggesting, and Benjamin Schwendinger for the PR. Thanks to @clerousset, @dcaseykc, @OfekShilon, @SeanShao98, and @ben519 for testing dev and filing detailed bug reports which were fixed before release and their tests added to the test suite.

38. `.I` is now available in `by` for rowwise operations, [#1732](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/1732). Thanks to Rafael H. M. Pereira for requesting, and Benjamin Schwendinger for the PR.

    ```R
    DT
    #       V1    V2
    #    <int> <int>
    # 1:     3     5
    # 2:     4     6

    DT[, sum(.SD), by=.I]
    #        I    V1
    #    <int> <int>
    # 1:     1     8
    # 2:     2    10
    ```

39.  New functions `yearmon()` and `yearqtr` give a combined representation of `year()` and `month()`/`quarter()`. These and also `yday`, `wday`, `mday`, `week`, `month` and `year` are now optimized for memory and compute efficiency by removing the `POSIXlt` dependency, [#649](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/649). Thanks to Matt Dowle for the request, and Benjamin Schwendinger for the PR. Thanks to @berg-michael for testing dev and filing a bug report for special case of missing values which was fixed before release.

40. New function `%notin%` provides a convenient alternative to `!(x %in% y)`, [#4152](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4152). Thanks to Jan Gorecki for suggesting and Michael Czekanski for the PR. `%notin%` uses half the memory because it computes the result directly as opposed to `!` which allocates a new vector to hold the negated result. If `x` is long enough to occupy more than half the remaining free memory, this can make the difference between the operation working, or failing with an out-of-memory error.

41. `tables()` is faster by default by excluding the size of character strings in R's global cache (which may be shared) and excluding the size of list column items (which also may be shared). `mb=` now accepts any function which accepts a `data.table` and returns a higher and better estimate of its size in bytes, albeit more slowly; e.g. `mb = utils::object.size`.

## BUG FIXES

1. `by=.EACHI` when `i` is keyed but `on=` different columns than `i`'s key could create an invalidly keyed result, [#4603](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4603) [#4911](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4911). Thanks to @myoung3 and @adamaltmejd for reporting, and @ColeMiller1 for the PR. An invalid key is where a `data.table` is marked as sorted by the key columns but the data is not sorted by those columns, leading to incorrect results from subsequent queries.

2. `print(DT, trunc.cols=TRUE)` and the corresponding `datatable.print.trunc.cols` option (new feature 3 in v1.13.0) could incorrectly display an extra column, [#4266](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4266). Thanks to @tdhock for the bug report and @MichaelChirico for the PR.

3. `fread(..., nrows=0L)` now works as intended and the same as `nrows=0`; i.e. returning the column names and typed empty columns determined by the large sample, [#4686](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4686), [#4029](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4029). Thanks to @hongyuanjia and @michaelpaulhirsch for reporting, and Benjamin Schwendinger for the PR. Also thanks to @HughParsonage for testing dev and reporting a bug which was fixed before release.

4. Passing `.SD` to `frankv()` with `ties.method='random'` or with `na.last=NA` failed with `.SD is locked`, [#4429](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4429). Thanks @smarches for the report.

5. Filtering data.table using `which=NA` to return non-matching indices will now properly work for non-optimized subsetting as well, closes [#4411](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4411).

6. When `j` returns an object whose class `"X"` inherits from `data.table`; i.e. class `c("X", "data.table", "data.frame")`, the derived class `"X"` is no longer incorrectly dropped from the class of the `data.table` returned, [#4324](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4324). Thanks to @HJAllen for reporting and @shrektan for the PR.

7. `as.data.table()` failed with `.subset2(x, i, exact = exact): attempt to select less than one element in get1index` when passed an object inheriting from `data.table` with a different `[[` method, such as the class `dfidx` from the `dfidx` package, [#4526](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4526). Thanks @RicoDiel for the report, and Michael Chirico for the PR.

8. `rbind()` and `rbindlist()` of length-0 ordered factors failed with `Internal error: savetl_init checks failed`, [#4795](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4795) [#4823](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4823). Thanks to @shrektan and @dbart79 for reporting, and @shrektan for fixing.

9. `data.table(NULL)[, firstCol:=1L]` created `data.table(firstCol=1L)` ok but did not update the internal `row.names` attribute, causing `Error in '$<-.data.frame'(x, name, value) : replacement has 1 row, data has 0` when passed to packages like `ggplot` which use `DT` as if it is a `data.frame`, [#4597](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4597). Thanks to Matthew Son for reporting, and Cole Miller for the PR.

10. `X[Y, .SD, by=]` (joining and grouping in the same query) could segfault if i) `by=` is supplied custom data (i.e. not simple expressions of columns), and ii) some rows of `Y` do not match to any rows in `X`, [#4892](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4892). Thanks to @Kodiologist for reporting, @ColeMiller1 for investigating, and @tlapak for the PR.

11. Assigning a set of 2 or more all-NA values to a factor column could segfault, [#4824](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4824). Thanks to @clerousset for reporting and @shrektan for fixing.

12. `as.data.table(table(NULL))` now returns `data.table(NULL)` rather than error `attempt to set an attribute on NULL`, [#4179](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4179). The result differs slightly to `as.data.frame(table(NULL))` (0-row, 1-column) because 0-column works better with other `data.table` functions like `rbindlist()`. Thanks to Michael Chirico for the report and fix.

13. `melt` with a list for `measure.vars` would output `variable` inconsistently between `na.rm=TRUE` and `FALSE`, [#4455](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4455). Thanks to @tdhock for reporting and fixing.

14. `by=...get()...` could fail with `object not found`, [#4873](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4873) [#4981](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4981). Thanks to @sindribaldur for reporting, and @OfekShilon for fixing.

15. `print(x, col.names='none')` now removes the column names as intended for wide `data.table`s whose column names don't fit on a single line, [#4270](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4270). Thanks to @tdhock for the report, and Michael Chirico for fixing.

16. `DT[, min(colB), by=colA]` when `colB` is type `character` would miss blank strings (`""`) at the beginning of a group and return the smallest non-blank instead of blank, [#4848](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4848). Thanks to Vadim Khotilovich for reporting and for the PR fixing it.

17. Assigning a wrong-length or non-list vector to a list column could segfault, [#4166](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4166) [#4667](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4667) [#4678](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4678) [#4729](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4729). Thanks to @fklirono, Kun Ren, @kevinvzandvoort and @peterlittlejohn for reporting, and to VÃ¡clav TlapÃ¡k for the PR.

18. `as.data.table()` on `xts` objects containing a column named `x` would return an `index` of type plain `integer` rather than `POSIXct`, [#4897](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4897). Thanks to Emil SjÃ¸rup for reporting, and Jan Gorecki for the PR.

19. A fix to `as.Date(c("", ...))` in R 4.0.3, [17909](https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=17909), has been backported to `data.table::as.IDate()` so that it too now returns `NA` for the first item when it is blank, even in older versions of R back to 3.1.0, rather than the incorrect error `character string is not in a standard unambiguous format`, [#4676](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4676). Thanks to Arun Srinivasan for reporting, and Michael Chirico both for the `data.table` PR and for submitting the patch to R that was accepted and included in R 4.0.3.

20. `uniqueN(DT, by=character())` is now equivalent to `uniqueN(DT)` rather than internal error `'by' is either not integer or is length 0`, [#4594](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4594). Thanks Marco Colombo for the report, and Michael Chirico for the PR. Similarly for `unique()`, `duplicated()` and `anyDuplicated()`.

21. `melt()` on a `data.table` with `list` columns for `measure.vars` would silently ignore `na.rm=TRUE`, [#5044](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5044). Now the same logic as `is.na()` from base R is used; i.e. if list element is scalar NA then it is considered missing and removed. Thanks to Toby Dylan Hocking for the PRs.

22. `fread(fill=TRUE)` could segfault if the input contained an improperly quoted character field, [#4774](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4774) [#5041](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5041). Thanks to @AndeolEvain and @e-nascimento for reporting and to VÃ¡clav TlapÃ¡k for the PR.

23. `fread(fill=TRUE, verbose=TRUE)` would segfault on the out-of-sample type bump verbose output if the input did not contain column names, [5046](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/pull/5046). Thanks to VÃ¡clav TlapÃ¡k for the PR.

24. `.SDcols=-V2:-V1` and `.SDcols=(-1)` could error with `xcolAns does not pass checks` and `argument specifying columns specify non existing column(s)`, [#4231](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4231). Thanks to Jan Gorecki for reporting and the PR. Thanks Toby Dylan Hocking for tracking down an error caused by the initial fix and Michael Chirico for fixing it.

25. `.SDcols=<logical vector>` is now documented in `?data.table` and it is now an error if the logical vector's length is not equal to the number of columns (consistent with `data.table`'s no-recycling policy; see new feature 1 in v1.12.2 Apr 2019), [#4115](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4115). Thanks to @Henrik-P for reporting and Jan Gorecki for the PR.

26. `melt()` now outputs scalar logical `NA` instead of `NULL` in rows corresponding to missing list columns, for consistency with non-list columns when using `na.rm=TRUE`, [#5053](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/pull/5053). Thanks to Toby Dylan Hocking for the PR.

27. `as.data.frame(DT)`, `setDF(DT)` and `as.list(DT)` now remove the `"index"` attribute which contains any indices (a.k.a. secondary keys), as they already did for other `data.table`-only attributes such as the primary key stored in the `"sorted"` attribute. When indices were left intact, a subsequent subset, assign, or reorder of the `data.frame` by `data.frame`-code in base R or other packages would not update the indices, causing incorrect results if then converted back to `data.table`, [#4889](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4889). Thanks @OfekShilon for the report and the PR.

28. `dplyr::arrange(DT)` uses `vctrs::vec_slice` which retains `data.table`'s class but uses C to bypass `[` method dispatch and does not adjust `data.table`'s attributes containing the index row numbers, [#5042](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5042). `data.table`'s long-standing `.internal.selfref` mechanism to detect such operations by other packages was not being checked by `data.table` when using indexes, causing `data.table` filters and joins to use invalid indexes and return incorrect results after a `dplyr::arrange(DT)`. Thanks to @Waldi73 for reporting; @avimallu, @tlapak, @MichaelChirico, @jangorecki and @hadley for investigating and suggestions; and @mattdowle for the PR. The intended way to use `data.table` is `data.table::setkey(DT, col1, col2, ...)` which reorders `DT` by reference in parallel, sets the primary key for automatic use by subsequent `data.table` queries, and permits rowname-like usage such as `DT["foo",]` which returns the now-contiguous-in-memory block of rows where the first column of `DT`'s key contains `"foo"`. Multi-column-rownames (i.e. a primary key of more than one column) can be looked up using `DT[.("foo",20210728L), ]`. Using `==` in `i` is also optimized to use the key or indices, if you prefer using column names explicitly and `==`. An alternative to `setkey(DT)` is returning a new ordered result using `DT[order(col1, col2, ...), ]`.

29. A segfault occurred when `nrow/throttle < nthread`, [#5077](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5077). With the default throttle of 1024 rows (see `?setDTthreads`), at least 64 threads would be needed to trigger the segfault since there needed to be more than 65,535 rows too. It occurred on a server with 256 logical cores where `data.table` uses 128 threads by default. Thanks to Bennet Becker for reporting, debugging at C level, and fixing. It also occurred when the throttle was increased so as to use fewer threads; e.g. at the limit `setDTthreads(throttle=nrow(DT))`.

30. `fread(file=URL)` now works rather than error `does not exist or is non-readable`, [#4952](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4952). `fread(URL)` and `fread(input=URL)` worked before and continue to work. Thanks to @pnacht for reporting and @ben-schwen for the PR.

31. `fwrite(DF, row.names=TRUE)` where `DF` has specific integer rownames (e.g. using `rownames(DF) <- c(10L,20L,30L)`) would ignore the integer rownames and write the row numbers instead, [#4957](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4957). Thanks to @dgarrimar for reporting and @ColeMiller1 for the PR. Further, when `quote='auto'` (default) and the rownames are integers (either default or specific), they are no longer quoted.

32. `test.data.table()` would fail on test 1894 if the variable `z` was defined by the user, [#3705](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/3705). The test suite already ran in its own separate environment. That environment's parent is no longer `.GlobalEnv` to isolate it further. Thanks to Michael Chirico for reporting, and Matt Dowle for the PR.

33. `fread(text="a,b,c")` (where input data contains no `\n` but `text=` has been used) now works instead of error `file not found: a,b,c`, [#4689](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4689). Thanks to @trainormg for reporting, and @ben-schwen for the PR.

34. `na.omit(DT)` did not remove `NA` in `nanotime` columns, [#4744](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4744). Thanks Jean-Mathieu Vermosen for reporting, and Michael Chirico for the PR.

35. `DT[, min(intCol, na.rm=TRUE), by=grp]` would return `Inf` for any groups containing all NAs, with a type change from `integer` to `numeric` to hold the `Inf`, and with warning. Similarly `max` would return `-Inf`. Now `NA` is returned for such all-NA groups, without warning or type change. This is almost-surely less surprising, more convenient, consistent, and efficient. There was no user request for this, likely because our desire to be consistent with base R in this regard was known (`base::min(x, na.rm=TRUE)` returns `Inf` with warning for all-NA input). Matt Dowle made this change when reworking internals, [#5105](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/pull/5105). The old behavior seemed so bad, and since there was a warning too, it seemed appropriate to treat it as a bug.

    ```R
    DT
    #         A     B
    #    <char> <int>
    # 1:      a     1
    # 2:      a    NA
    # 3:      b     2
    # 4:      b    NA

    DT[, min(B,na.rm=TRUE), by=A]  # no change in behavior (no all-NA groups yet)
    #         A    V1
    #    <char> <int>
    # 1:      a     1
    # 2:      b     2

    DT[3, B:=NA]                   # make an all-NA group
    DT
    #         A     B
    #    <char> <int>
    # 1:      a     1
    # 2:      a    NA
    # 3:      b    NA
    # 4:      b    NA

    DT[, min(B,na.rm=TRUE), by=A]  # old result
    #         A    V1
    #    <char> <num>              # V1's type changed to numeric (inconsistent)
    # 1:      a     1
    # 2:      b   Inf              # Inf surprising
    # Warning message:             # warning inconvenient
    # In gmin(B, na.rm = TRUE) :
    #   No non-missing values found in at least one group. Coercing to numeric
    #   type and returning 'Inf' for such groups to be consistent with base

    DT[, min(B,na.rm=TRUE), by=A]  # new result
    #         A    V1
    #    <char> <int>              # V1's type remains integer (consistent)
    # 1:      a     1
    # 2:      b    NA              # NA because there are no non-NA, naturally
                                   # no inconvenient warning
    ```

    On the same basis, `min` and `max` methods for empty `IDate` input now return `NA_integer_` of class `IDate`, rather than `NA_double_` of class `IDate` together with base R's warning `no non-missing arguments to min; returning Inf`, [#2256](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/2256). The type change and warning would cause an error in grouping, see example below. Since `NA` was returned before it seems clear that still returning `NA` but of the correct type and with no warning is appropriate, backwards compatible, and a bug fix. Thanks to Frank Narf for reporting, and Matt Dowle for fixing.

    ```R
    DT
    #             d      g
    #        <IDat> <char>
    # 1: 2020-01-01      a
    # 2: 2020-01-02      a
    # 3: 2019-12-31      b

    DT[, min(d[d>"2020-01-01"]), by=g]

    # was:

    # Error in `[.data.table`(DT, , min(d[d > "2020-01-01"]), by = g) :
    #   Column 1 of result for group 2 is type 'double' but expecting type
    #   'integer'. Column types must be consistent for each group.
    # In addition: Warning message:
    # In min.default(integer(0), na.rm = FALSE) :
    #   no non-missing arguments to min; returning Inf

    # now :

    #         g         V1
    #    <char>     <IDat>
    # 1:      a 2020-01-02
    # 2:      b       <NA>
    ```

36. `DT[, min(int64Col), by=grp]` (and `max`) would return incorrect results for `bit64::integer64` columns, [#4444](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4444). Thanks to @go-see for reporting, and Michael Chirico for the PR.

37. `fread(dec=',')` was able to guess `sep=','` and return an incorrect result, [#4483](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4483). Thanks to Michael Chirico for reporting and fixing. It was already an error to provide both `sep=','` and `dec=','` manually.

    ```R
    fread('A|B|C\n1|0,4|a\n2|0,5|b\n', dec=',')  # no problem

    #        A     B      C
    #    <int> <num> <char>
    # 1:     1   0.4      a
    # 2:     2   0.5      b

    fread('A|B,C\n1|0,4\n2|0,5\n', dec=',')

    #       A|B     C    # old result guessed sep=',' despite dec=','
    #    <char> <int>
    # 1:    1|0     4
    # 2:    2|0     5

    #        A   B,C     # now detects sep='|' correctly
    #    <int> <num>
    # 1:     1   0.4
    # 2:     2   0.5
    ```

38. `IDateTime()` ignored the `tz=` and `format=` arguments because `...` was not passed through to submethods, [#2402](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/pull/2402). Thanks to Frank Narf for reporting, and Jens Peder Meldgaard for the PR.

    ```
    IDateTime("20171002095500", format="%Y%m%d%H%M%S")

    # was :
    # Error in charToDate(x) :
    #   character string is not in a standard unambiguous format

    # now :
    #         idate    itime
    #        <IDat>  <ITime>
    # 1: 2017-10-02 09:55:00
    ```

39. `DT[i, sum(b), by=grp]` (and other optimized-by-group aggregates: `mean`, `var`, `sd`, `median`, `prod`, `min`, `max`, `first`, `last`, `head` and `tail`) could segfault if `i` contained row numbers and one or more were NA, [#1994](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/1994). Thanks to Arun Srinivasan for reporting, and Benjamin Schwendinger for the PR.

40. `identical(fread(text="A\n0.8060667366\n")$A, 0.8060667366)` is now TRUE, [#4461](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4461). This is one of 13 numbers in the set of 100,000 between 0.80606 and 0.80607 in 0.0000000001 increments that were not already identical. In all 13 cases R's parser (same as `read.table`) and `fread` straddled the true value by a very similar small amount. `fread` now uses `/10^n` rather than `*10^-n` to match R identically in all cases. Thanks to Gabe Becker for requesting consistency, and Michael Chirico for the PR.

    ```R
    for (i in 0:99999) {
      s = sprintf("0.80606%05d", i)
      r = eval(parse(text=s))
      f = fread(text=paste0("A\n",s,"\n"))$A
      if (!identical(r, f))
        cat(s, sprintf("%1.18f", c(r, f, r)), "\n")
    }

41. `dcast(empty-DT)` now returns an empty `data.table` rather than error `Cannot cast an empty data.table`, [#1215](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/1215). Thanks to Damian Betebenner for reporting, and Matt Dowle for fixing.

42. `DT[factor("id")]` now works rather than error `i has evaluated to type integer. Expecting logical, integer or double`, [#1632](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/1632). `DT["id"]` has worked forever by automatically converting to `DT[.("id")]` for convenience, and joins have worked forever between char/fact, fact/char and fact/fact even when levels mismatch, so it was unfortunate that `DT[factor("id")]` managed to escape the simple automatic conversion to `DT[.(factor("id"))]` which is now in place. Thanks to @aushev for reporting, and Matt Dowle for the fix.

43. All-NA character key columns could segfault, [#5070](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5070). Thanks to @JorisChau for reporting and Benjamin Schwendinger for the fix.

44. In v1.13.2 a version of an old bug was reintroduced where during a grouping operation list columns could retain a pointer to the last group. This affected only attributes of list elements and only if those were updated during the grouping operation, [#4963](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4963). Thanks to @fujiaxiang for reporting and @avimallu and VÃ¡clav TlapÃ¡k for investigating and the PR.

45. `shift(xInt64, fill=0)` and `shift(xInt64, fill=as.integer64(0))` (but not `shift(xInt64, fill=0L)`) would error with `INTEGER() can only be applied to a 'integer', not a 'double'` where `xInt64` conveys `bit64::integer64`, `0` is type `double` and `0L` is type integer, [#4865](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4865). Thanks to @peterlittlejohn for reporting and Benjamin Schwendinger for the PR.

46. `DT[i, strCol:=classVal]` did not coerce using the `as.character` method for the class, resulting in either an unexpected string value or an error such as `To assign integer64 to a target of type character, please use as.character() for clarity`. Discovered during work on the previous issue, [#5189](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/pull/5189).

    ```R
    DT
    #         A
    #    <char>
    # 1:      a
    # 2:      b
    # 3:      c
    DT[2, A:=as.IDate("2021-02-03")]
    DT[3, A:=bit64::as.integer64("4611686018427387906")]
    DT
    #                      A
    #                 <char>
    # 1:                   a
    # 2:          2021-02-03  # was 18661
    # 3: 4611686018427387906  # was error 'please use as.character'
    ```

47. `tables()` failed with `argument "..." is missing` when called from within a function taking `...`; e.g. `function(...) { tables() }`, [#5197](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5197). Thanks @greg-minshall for the report and @michaelchirico for the fix.

48. `DT[, prod(int64Col), by=grp]` produced wrong results for `bit64::integer64` due to incorrect optimization, [#5225](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5225). Thanks to Benjamin Schwendinger for reporting and fixing.

49. `fintersect(..., all=TRUE)` and `fsetdiff(..., all=TRUE)` could return incorrect results when the inputs had columns named `x` and `y`, [#5255](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5255). Thanks @Fpadt for the report, and @ben-schwen for the fix.

50. `fwrite()` could produce not-ISO-compliant timestamps such as `2023-03-08T17:22:32.:00Z` when under a whole second by less than numerical tolerance of one microsecond, [#5238](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5238). Thanks to @avraam-inside for the report and VÃ¡clav TlapÃ¡k for the fix.

51. `merge.data.table()` silently ignored the `incomparables` argument, [#2587](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/2587). It is now implemented and any other ignored arguments (e.g. misspellings) are now warned about. Thanks to @GBsuperman for the report and @ben-schwen for the fix.

52. `DT[, c('z','x') := {x=NULL; list(2,NULL)}]` now removes column `x` as expected rather than incorrectly assigning `2` to `x` as well as `z`, [#5284](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5284). The `x=NULL` is superfluous while the `list(2,NULL)` is the final value of `{}` whose items correspond to `c('z','x')`. Thanks @eutwt for the report, and @ben-schwen for the fix.

53. `as.data.frame(DT, row.names=)` no longer silently ignores `row.names`, [#5319](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5319). Thanks to @dereckdemezquita for the fix and PR, and @ben-schwen for guidance.

54. `data.table(...)` unnamed arguments are deparsed in an attempt to name the columns but when called from `do.call()` the input data itself was deparsed taking a very long time, [#5501](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/pull/5501). Many thanks to @OfekShilon for the report and fix, and @michaelchirico for guidance. Unnamed arguments to `data.table(...)` may now be faster in other cases not involving `do.call()` too; e.g. expressions spanning a lot of lines or other function call constructions that led to the data itself being deparsed.

    ```R
    DF = data.frame(a=runif(1e6), b=runif(1e6))
    DT1 = data.table(DF)                 # 0.02s before and after
    DT2 = do.call(data.table, list(DF))  # 3.07s before, 0.02s after
    identical(DT1, DT2)                  # TRUE
    ```

55. `fread(URL)` with `https:` and `ftps:` could timeout if proxy settings were not guessed right by `curl::curl_download`, [#1686](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/1686). `fread(URL)` now uses `download.file()` as default for downloading files from urls. Thanks to @cderv for the report and Benjamin Schwendinger for the fix.

56. `split.data.table()` works for downstream methods that don't implement `DT[i]` form (i.e., requiring `DT[i, j]` form, like plain `data.frame`s), for example `sf`'s `[.sf`, [#5365](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5365). Thanks @barryrowlingson for the report and @michaelchirico for the fix.

## NOTES

1. New feature 29 in v1.12.4 (Oct 2019) introduced zero-copy coercion. Our thinking is that requiring you to get the type right in the case of `0` (type double) vs `0L` (type integer) is too inconvenient for you the user. So such coercions happen in `data.table` automatically without warning. Thanks to zero-copy coercion there is no speed penalty, even when calling `set()` many times in a loop, so there's no speed penalty to warn you about either. However, we believe that assigning a character value such as `"2"` into an integer column is more likely to be a user mistake that you would like to be warned about. The type difference (character vs integer) may be the only clue that you have selected the wrong column, or typed the wrong variable to be assigned to that column. For this reason we view character to numeric-like coercion differently and will warn about it. If it is correct, then the warning is intended to nudge you to wrap the RHS with `as.<type>()` so that it is clear to readers of your code that a coercion from character to that type is intended. For example :

    ```R
    x = c(2L,NA,4L,5L)
    nafill(x, fill=3)                 # no warning; requiring 3L too inconvenient
    nafill(x, fill="3")               # warns in case either x or "3" was a mistake
    nafill(x, fill=3.14)              # warns that precision has been lost
    nafill(x, fill=as.integer(3.14))  # no warning; the as.<type> conveys intent
    ```

2. `CsubsetDT` exported C function has been renamed to `DT_subsetDT`. This requires `R_GetCCallable("data.table", "CsubsetDT")` to be updated to `R_GetCCallable("data.table", "DT_subsetDT")`. Additionally there is now a dedicated header file for data.table C exports `include/datatableAPI.h`, [#4643](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4643), thanks to @eddelbuettel, which makes it easier to _import_ data.table C functions.

3. In v1.12.4, fractional `fread(..., stringsAsFactors=)` was added. For example if `stringsAsFactors=0.2`, any character column with fewer than 20% unique strings would be cast as `factor`. This is now documented in `?fread` as well, [#4706](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4706). Thanks to @markderry for the PR.

4. `cube(DT, by="a")` now gives a more helpful error that `j` is missing, [#4282](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/pull/4282).

5. v1.13.0 (July 2020) fixed a segfault/corruption/error (depending on version of R and circumstances) in `dcast()` when `fun.aggregate` returned `NA` (type `logical`) in an otherwise `character` result, [#2394](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/2394). This fix was the result of other internal rework and there was no news item at the time. A new test to cover this case has now been added. Thanks Vadim Khotilovich for reporting, and Michael Chirico for investigating, pinpointing when the fix occurred and adding the test.

6. `DT[subset]` where `DT[(subset)]` or `DT[subset==TRUE]` was intended; i.e., subsetting by a logical column whose name conflicts with an existing function, now gives a friendlier error message, [#5014](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5014). Thanks @michaelchirico for the suggestion and PR, and @ColeMiller1 for helping with the fix.

7. Grouping by a `list` column has its error message improved stating this is unsupported, [#4308](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4308). Thanks @sindribaldur for filing, and @michaelchirico for the PR. Please add your vote and especially use cases to the [#1597](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/1597) feature request.

8. OpenBSD 6.9 released May 2021 uses a 16 year old version of zlib (v1.2.3 from 2005) plus cherry-picked bug fixes (i.e. a semi-fork of zlib) which induces `Compress gzip error: -9` from `fwrite()`, [#5048](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5048). Thanks to Philippe Chataignon for investigating and fixing. Matt asked on OpenBSD's mailing list if zlib could be upgraded to 4 year old zlib 1.2.11 but forgot his tin hat: https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-misc&m=162455479311886&w=1.

9. `?"."`, `?".."`, `?".("`, and `?".()"` now point to `?data.table`, [#4385](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4385) [#4407](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4407). To help users find the documentation for these convenience features available inside `DT[...]`. Recall that `.` is an alias for `list`, and `..var` tells `data.table` to look for `var` in the calling environment as opposed to a column of the table.

10. `DT[, lhs:=rhs]` and `set(DT, , lhs, rhs)` no longer raise a warning on zero length `lhs`, [#4086](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4086). Thanks to Jan Gorecki for the suggestion and PR. For example, `DT[, grep("foo", names(dt)) := NULL]` no longer warns if there are no column names containing `"foo"`.

11. `melt()`'s internal C code is now more memory efficient, [#5054](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/pull/5054). Thanks to Toby Dylan Hocking for the PR.

12. `?merge` and `?setkey` have been updated to clarify that the row order is retained when `sort=FALSE`, and why `NA`s are always first when `sort=TRUE`, [#2574](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/2574) [#2594](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/2594). Thanks to Davor Josipovic and Markus Bonsch for the reports, and Jan Gorecki for the PR.

13. For nearly two years, since v1.12.4 (Oct 2019) (note 11 below in this NEWS file), using `options(datatable.nomatch=0)` has produced the following message :

    ```
    The option 'datatable.nomatch' is being used and is not set to the default NA. This option
    is still honored for now but will be deprecated in future. Please see NEWS for 1.12.4 for
    detailed information and motivation. To specify inner join, please specify `nomatch=NULL`
    explicitly in your calls rather than changing the default using this option.
    ```

    The message is now upgraded to warning that the option is now ignored.

14. The options `datatable.print.class` and `datatable.print.keys` are now `TRUE` by default. They have been available since v1.9.8 (Nov 2016) and v1.11.0 (May 2018) respectively.

15. Thanks to @ssh352, VÃ¡clav TlapÃ¡k, Cole Miller, AndrÃ¡s Svraka and Toby Dylan Hocking for reporting and bisecting a significant performance regression in dev. This was fixed before release thanks to a PR by Jan Gorecki, [#5463](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/pull/5463). 

16. `key(x) <- value` is now fully deprecated (from warning to error). Use `setkey()` to set a table's key. We started warning not to use this approach in 2012, with a stronger warning starting in 2019 (1.12.2). This function will be removed in the next release.

17. Argument `logicalAsInt` to `fwrite()` now warns. Use `logical01` instead. We stated the intention to begin removing this option in 2018 (v1.11.0). It will be upgraded to an error in the next release before being removed in the subsequent release.

18. Option `datatable.CJ.names` no longer has any effect, after becoming `TRUE` by default in v1.12.2 (2019). Setting it now gives a warning, which will be dropped in the next release.

19. In the NEWS for v1.11.0 (May 2018), section "NOTICE OF INTENDED FUTURE POTENTIAL BREAKING CHANGES" item 2, we stated the intention to eventually change `logical01` to be `TRUE` by default. After some consideration, reflection, and community input, we have decided not to move forward with this plan, i.e., `logical01` will remain `FALSE` by default in both `fread()` and `fwrite()`. See discussion in #5856; most importantly, we think changing the default would be a major disruption to reading "sharded" CSVs where data with the same schema is split into many files, some of which could be converted to `logical` while others remain `integer`. We will retain the option `datatable.logical01` for users who wish to use a different default -- for example, if you are doing input/output on tables with a large number of logical columns, where writing '0'/'1' to the CSV many millions of times is preferable to writing 'TRUE'/'FALSE'.

20. Some clarity is added to `?GForce` for the case when subtle changes to `j` produce different results because of differences in locale. Because `data.table` _always_ uses the "C" locale, small changes to queries which activate/deactivate GForce might cause confusingly different results when sorting is involved, [#5331](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5331). The inspirational example compared `DT[, .(max(a), max(b)), by=grp]` and `DT[, .(max(a), max(tolower(b))), by=grp]` -- in the latter case, GForce is deactivated owing to the _ad-hoc_ column, so the result for `max(a)` might differ for the two queries. An example is added to `?GForce`. As always, there are several options to guarantee consistency, for example (1) use namespace qualification to deactivate GForce: `DT[, .(base::max(a), base::max(b)), by=grp]`; (2) turn off all optimizations with `options(datatable.optimize = 0)`; or (3) set your R session to always sort in C locale with `Sys.setlocale("LC_COLLATE", "C")` (or temporarily with e.g. `withr::with_locale()`). Thanks @markseeto for the example and @michaelchirico for the improved documentation.

This document is meant to guide on measuring performance of `data.table`. Single place to document best practices and traps to avoid.

# fread: clear caches

Ideally each `fread` call should be run in fresh session with the following commands preceding R execution. This clears OS cache file in RAM and HD cache.

```sh
free -g
sudo sh -c 'echo 3 >/proc/sys/vm/drop_caches'
sudo lshw -class disk
sudo hdparm -t /dev/sda
```

When comparing `fread` to non-R solutions be aware that R requires values of character columns to be added to _R's global string cache_. This takes time when reading data but later operations benefit since the character strings have already been cached. Consequently, in addition to timing isolated tasks (such as `fread` alone), it's a good idea to benchmark the total time of an end-to-end pipeline of tasks such as reading data, manipulating it, and producing final output.

# subset: threshold for index optimization on compound queries

Index optimization for compound filter queries will be not be used when cross product of elements provided to filter on exceeds 1e4 elements.

```r
DT = data.table(V1=1:10, V2=1:10, V3=1:10, V4=1:10)
setindex(DT)
v = c(1L, rep(11L, 9))
length(v)^4               # cross product of elements in filter
#[1] 10000                # <= 10000
DT[V1 %in% v & V2 %in% v & V3 %in% v & V4 %in% v, verbose=TRUE]
#Optimized subsetting with index 'V1__V2__V3__V4'
#on= matches existing index, using index
#Starting bmerge ...done in 0.000sec
#...
v = c(1L, rep(11L, 10))
length(v)^4               # cross product of elements in filter
#[1] 14641                # > 10000
DT[V1 %in% v & V2 %in% v & V3 %in% v & V4 %in% v, verbose=TRUE]
#Subsetting optimization disabled because the cross-product of RHS values exceeds 1e4, causing memory problems.
#...
```

# subset: index aware benchmarking

For convenience `data.table` automatically builds an index on fields you use to subset data. It will add some overhead to first subset on particular fields but greatly reduces time to query those columns in subsequent runs. When measuring speed, the best way is to measure index creation and query using an index separately. Having such timings it is easy to decide what is the optimal strategy for your use case.
To control usage of index use following options:

```r
options(datatable.auto.index=TRUE)
options(datatable.use.index=TRUE)
```

- `use.index=FALSE` will force the query not to use indices even if they exist, but existing keys are still used for optimization.
- `auto.index=FALSE` disables building index automatically when doing subset on non-indexed data, but if indices were created before this option was set, or explicitly by calling `setindex` they still will be used for optimization.

Two other options control optimization globally, including use of indices:
```r
options(datatable.optimize=2L)
options(datatable.optimize=3L)
```
`options(datatable.optimize=2L)` will turn off optimization of subsets completely, while `options(datatable.optimize=3L)` will switch it back on.
Those options affect many more optimizations and thus should not be used when only control of indices is needed. Read more in `?datatable.optimize`.

# _by reference_ operations

When benchmarking `set*` functions it only makes sense to measure the first run. These functions update their input by reference, so subsequent runs will use the already-processed `data.table`, biasing the results. 

Protecting your `data.table` from being updated by reference operations can be achieved using `copy` or `data.table:::shallow` functions. Be aware `copy` might be very expensive as it needs to duplicate whole object. It is unlikely we want to include duplication time in time of the actual task we are benchmarking.

# try to benchmark atomic processes

If your benchmark is meant to be published it will be much more insightful if you will split it to measure time of atomic processes. This way your readers can see how much time was spent on reading data from source, cleaning, actual transformation, exporting results.
Of course if your benchmark is meant to present to present an _end-to-end workflow_, then it makes perfect sense to present the overall timing. Nevertheless, separating out timing of individual steps is useful for understanding which steps are the main bottlenecks of a workflow.
There are other cases when atomic benchmarking might not be desirable, for example when _reading a csv_, followed by _grouping_. R requires populating _R's global string cache_ which adds extra overhead when importing character data to an R session. On the other hand, the _global string cache_ might speed up processes like _grouping_. In such cases when comparing R to other languages it might be useful to include total timing.

# avoid class coercion

Unless this is what you truly want to measure you should prepare input objects of the expected class for every tool you are benchmarking.

# avoid `microbenchmark(..., times=100)`

Repeating a benchmark many times usually does not give the clearest picture for data processing tools. Of course, it makes perfect sense for more atomic calculations, but this is not a good representation of the most common way these tools will actually be used, namely for data processing tasks, which consist of batches of sequentially provided transformations, each run once.
Matt once said:

> I'm very wary of benchmarks measured in anything under 1 second. Much prefer 10 seconds or more for a single run, achieved by increasing data size. A repetition count of 500 is setting off alarm bells. 3-5 runs should be enough to convince on larger data. Call overhead and time to GC affect inferences at this very small scale.

This is very valid. The smaller time measurement is the relatively bigger noise is. Noise generated by method dispatch, package/class initialization, etc. Main focus of benchmark should be on real use case scenarios.

# multithreaded processing

One of the main factors that is likely to impact timings is the number of threads available to your R session. In recent versions of `data.table`, some functions are parallelized.
You can control the number of threads you want to use with `setDTthreads`.

```r
setDTthreads(0)    # use all available cores (default)
getDTthreads()     # check how many cores are currently used
```

# inside a loop prefer `set` instead of `:=`

Unless you are utilizing index when doing _sub-assign by reference_ you should prefer `set` function which does not impose overhead of `[.data.table` method call.

```r
DT = data.table(a=3:1, b=letters[1:3])
setindex(DT, a)

# for (...) {                 # imagine loop here

  DT[a==2L, b := "z"]         # sub-assign by reference, uses index
  DT[, d := "z"]              # not sub-assign by reference, not uses index and adds overhead of `[.data.table`
  set(DT, j="d", value="z")   # no `[.data.table` overhead, but no index yet, till #1196

# }
```

# inside a loop prefer `setDT` instead of `data.table()`

As of now `data.table()` has an overhead, thus inside loops it is preferred to use `as.data.table()` or `setDT()` on a valid list.

<p>This document is meant to guide on measuring performance of <code>data.table</code>. Single place to document best practices and traps to avoid.</p>
<h1 id="fread-clear-caches"><span class="section-number">1.</span> fread: clear caches</h1>
<p>Ideally each <code>fread</code> call should be run in fresh session with the following commands preceding R execution. This clears OS cache file in RAM and HD cache.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">free -g
sudo sh -c 'echo 3 &gt;/proc/sys/vm/drop_caches'
sudo lshw -class disk
sudo hdparm -t /dev/sda
</code></pre>
<p>When comparing <code>fread</code> to non-R solutions be aware that R requires values of character columns to be added to <em>Râ€™s global string cache</em>. This takes time when reading data but later operations benefit since the character strings have already been cached. Consequently, in addition to timing isolated tasks (such as <code>fread</code> alone), itâ€™s a good idea to benchmark the total time of an end-to-end pipeline of tasks such as reading data, manipulating it, and producing final output.</p>
<h1 id="subset-threshold-for-index-optimization-on-compound-queries"><span class="section-number">2.</span> subset: threshold for index optimization on compound queries</h1>
<p>Index optimization for compound filter queries will be not be used when cross product of elements provided to filter on exceeds 1e4 elements.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">DT = data.table(V1=1:10, V2=1:10, V3=1:10, V4=1:10)
setindex(DT)
v = c(1L, rep(11L, 9))
length(v)^4               # cross product of elements in filter

<h1 id="subset-index-aware-benchmarking"><span class="section-number">3.</span> subset: index aware benchmarking</h1>
<p>For convenience <code>data.table</code> automatically builds an index on fields you use to subset data. It will add some overhead to first subset on particular fields but greatly reduces time to query those columns in subsequent runs. When measuring speed, the best way is to measure index creation and query using an index separately. Having such timings it is easy to decide what is the optimal strategy for your use case.
To control usage of index use following options:</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">options(datatable.auto.index=TRUE)
options(datatable.use.index=TRUE)
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><code>use.index=FALSE</code> will force the query not to use indices even if they exist, but existing keys are still used for optimization.</li>
<li><code>auto.index=FALSE</code> disables building index automatically when doing subset on non-indexed data, but if indices were created before this option was set, or explicitly by calling <code>setindex</code> they still will be used for optimization.</li>
</ul>
<p>Two other options control optimization globally, including use of indices:</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">options(datatable.optimize=2L)
options(datatable.optimize=3L)
</code></pre>
<p><code>options(datatable.optimize=2L)</code> will turn off optimization of subsets completely, while <code>options(datatable.optimize=3L)</code> will switch it back on.
Those options affect many more optimizations and thus should not be used when only control of indices is needed. Read more in <code>?datatable.optimize</code>.</p>
<h1 id="by-reference-operations"><span class="section-number">4.</span> <em>by reference</em> operations</h1>
<p>When benchmarking <code>set*</code> functions it only makes sense to measure the first run. These functions update their input by reference, so subsequent runs will use the already-processed <code>data.table</code>, biasing the results.</p>
<p>Protecting your <code>data.table</code> from being updated by reference operations can be achieved using <code>copy</code> or <code>data.table:::shallow</code> functions. Be aware <code>copy</code> might be very expensive as it needs to duplicate whole object. It is unlikely we want to include duplication time in time of the actual task we are benchmarking.</p>
<h1 id="try-to-benchmark-atomic-processes"><span class="section-number">5.</span> try to benchmark atomic processes</h1>
<p>If your benchmark is meant to be published it will be much more insightful if you will split it to measure time of atomic processes. This way your readers can see how much time was spent on reading data from source, cleaning, actual transformation, exporting results.
Of course if your benchmark is meant to present to present an <em>end-to-end workflow</em>, then it makes perfect sense to present the overall timing. Nevertheless, separating out timing of individual steps is useful for understanding which steps are the main bottlenecks of a workflow.
There are other cases when atomic benchmarking might not be desirable, for example when <em>reading a csv</em>, followed by <em>grouping</em>. R requires populating <em>Râ€™s global string cache</em> which adds extra overhead when importing character data to an R session. On the other hand, the <em>global string cache</em> might speed up processes like <em>grouping</em>. In such cases when comparing R to other languages it might be useful to include total timing.</p>
<h1 id="avoid-class-coercion"><span class="section-number">6.</span> avoid class coercion</h1>
<p>Unless this is what you truly want to measure you should prepare input objects of the expected class for every tool you are benchmarking.</p>
<h1 id="avoid-microbenchmark-times-100"><span class="section-number">7.</span> avoid <code>microbenchmark(..., times=100)</code></h1>
<p>Repeating a benchmark many times usually does not give the clearest picture for data processing tools. Of course, it makes perfect sense for more atomic calculations, but this is not a good representation of the most common way these tools will actually be used, namely for data processing tasks, which consist of batches of sequentially provided transformations, each run once.
Matt once said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Iâ€™m very wary of benchmarks measured in anything under 1 second. Much prefer 10 seconds or more for a single run, achieved by increasing data size. A repetition count of 500 is setting off alarm bells. 3-5 runs should be enough to convince on larger data. Call overhead and time to GC affect inferences at this very small scale.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is very valid. The smaller time measurement is the relatively bigger noise is. Noise generated by method dispatch, package/class initialization, etc. Main focus of benchmark should be on real use case scenarios.</p>
<h1 id="multithreaded-processing"><span class="section-number">8.</span> multithreaded processing</h1>
<p>One of the main factors that is likely to impact timings is the number of threads available to your R session. In recent versions of <code>data.table</code>, some functions are parallelized.
You can control the number of threads you want to use with <code>setDTthreads</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">setDTthreads(0)    # use all available cores (default)
getDTthreads()     # check how many cores are currently used
</code></pre>
<h1 id="inside-a-loop-prefer-set-instead-of"><span class="section-number">9.</span> inside a loop prefer <code>set</code> instead of <code>:=</code></h1>
<p>Unless you are utilizing index when doing <em>sub-assign by reference</em> you should prefer <code>set</code> function which does not impose overhead of <code>[.data.table</code> method call.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">DT = data.table(a=3:1, b=letters[1:3])
setindex(DT, a)

# for (...) {                 # imagine loop here

  DT[a==2L, b := &quot;z&quot;]         # sub-assign by reference, uses index
  DT[, d := &quot;z&quot;]              # not sub-assign by reference, not uses index and adds overhead of `[.data.table`
  set(DT, j=&quot;d&quot;, value=&quot;z&quot;)   # no `[.data.table` overhead, but no index yet, till #1196

# }
</code></pre>
<h1 id="inside-a-loop-prefer-setdt-instead-of-data-table"><span class="section-number">10.</span> inside a loop prefer <code>setDT</code> instead of <code>data.table()</code></h1>
<p>As of now <code>data.table()</code> has an overhead, thus inside loops it is preferred to use <code>as.data.table()</code> or <code>setDT()</code> on a valid list.</p>

The first section, Beginner FAQs, is intended to be read in order, from start to finish.  It's just written in a FAQ style to be digested more easily. It isn't really the most frequently asked questions. A better measure for that is looking on Stack Overflow.

This FAQ is required reading and considered core documentation. Please do not ask questions on Stack Overflow or raise issues on GitHub until you have read it. We can all tell when you ask that you haven't read it. So if you do ask and haven't read it, don't use your real name.

This document has been quickly revised given the changes in v1.9.8 released Nov 2016. Please do submit pull requests to fix mistakes or improvements.  If anyone knows why the table of contents comes out so narrow and squashed when displayed by CRAN, please let us know.  This document used to be a PDF and we changed it recently to HTML.


# Beginner FAQs

## Why do `DT[ , 5]` and `DT[2, 5]` return a 1-column data.table rather than vectors like `data.frame`? {#j-num}

For consistency so that when you use data.table in functions that accept varying inputs, you can rely on `DT[...]` returning a data.table. You don't have to remember to include `drop=FALSE` like you do in data.frame. data.table was first released in 2006 and this difference to data.frame has been a feature since the very beginning.

You may have heard that it is generally bad practice to refer to columns by number rather than name, though. If your colleague comes along and reads your code later they may have to hunt around to find out which column is number 5. If you or they change the column ordering higher up in your R program, you may produce wrong results with no warning or error if you forget to change all the places in your code which refer to column number 5. That is your fault not R's or data.table's. It's really really bad. Please don't do it. It's the same mantra as professional SQL developers have: never use `select *`, always explicitly select by column name to at least try to be robust to future changes.

Say column 5 is named `"region"` and you really must extract that column as a vector not a data.table. It is more robust to use the column name and write `DT$region` or `DT[["region"]]`; i.e., the same as base R. Using base R's `$` and `[[` on data.table is encouraged. Not when combined with `<-` to assign (use `:=` instead for that) but just to select a single column by name they are encouraged.

There are some circumstances where referring to a column by number seems like the only way, such as a sequence of columns. In these situations just like data.frame, you can write `DT[, 5:10]` and `DT[,c(1,4,10)]`. However, again, it is more robust (to future changes in your data's number of and ordering of columns) to use a named range such as `DT[,columnRed:columnViolet]` or name each one `DT[,c("columnRed","columnOrange","columnYellow")]`. It is harder work up front, but you will probably thank yourself and your colleagues might thank you in the future. At least you can say you tried your best to write robust code if something does go wrong.

However, what we really want you to do is `DT[,.(columnRed,columnOrange,columnYellow)]`; i.e., use column names as if they are variables directly inside `DT[...]`. You don't have to prefix each column with `DT$` like you do in data.frame. The `.()` part is just an alias for `list()` and you can use `list()` instead if you prefer. You can place any R expression of column names, using any R package, returning different types of different lengths, right there. We wanted to encourage you to do that so strongly in the past that we deliberately didn't make `DT[,5]` work at all. Before v1.9.8 released Nov 2016, `DT[,5]` used to just return `5`. The thinking was that we could more simply teach one fact that the parts inside `DT[...]` get evaluated within the frame of DT always (they see column names as if they are variables). And `5` evaluates to `5` so that behaviour was consistent with the single rule. We asked you to go through an extra deliberate hurdle `DT[,5,with=FALSE]` if you really wanted to select a column by name or number. Going forward from Nov 2016, you don't need to use `with=FALSE` and we'll see how greater consistency with data.frame in this regard will help or hinder both new and long-time users. The new users who don't read this FAQ, not even this very first entry, will hopefully not stumble as soon with data.table as they did before if they had expected it to work like data.frame. Hopefully they will not miss out on understanding our intent and recommendation to place expressions of columns inside `DT[i, j, by]`. If they use data.table like data.frame they won't gain any benefits. If you know anyone like that, please give them a friendly nudge to read this document like you are.

Reminder: you can place _any_ R expression inside `DT[...]` using column names as if they are variables; e.g., try `DT[, colA*colB/2]`. That does return a vector because you used column names as if they are variables. Wrap with `.()` to return a data.table; i.e. `DT[,.(colA*colB/2)]`.  Name it: `DT[,.(myResult = colA*colB/2)]`.  And we'll leave it to you to guess how to return two things from this query. It's also quite common to do a bunch of things inside an anonymous body: `DT[, { x<-colA+10; x*x/2 }]` or call another package's function: `DT[ , fitdistr(columnA, "normal")]`.

## Why does `DT[,"region"]` return a 1-column data.table rather than a vector?

See the [answer above](#j-num). Try `DT$region` instead. Or `DT[["region"]]`.


## Why does `DT[, region]` return a vector for the "region" column?  I'd like a 1-column data.table.

Try `DT[ , .(region)]` instead. `.()` is an alias for `list()` and ensures a data.table is returned.

Also continue reading and see the FAQ after next. Skim whole documents before getting stuck in one part.

## Why does `DT[ , x, y, z]` not work? I wanted the 3 columns `x`,`y` and `z`.

The `j` expression is the 2nd argument. Try `DT[ , c("x","y","z")]` or `DT[ , .(x,y,z)]`.

## I assigned a variable `mycol="x"` but then `DT[, mycol]` returns an error. How do I get it to look up the column name contained in the `mycol` variable?

The error is that column named `"mycol"` cannot be found, and this error is correct. `data.table`'s scoping is different to `data.frame` in that you can use column names as if they are variables directly inside `DT[...]` without prefixing each column name with `DT$`; see FAQ 1.1 above.

To use `mycol` to select the column `x` from `DT`, there are a few options:

```r
DT[, ..mycol]            # .. prefix conveys to look for the mycol one level up in calling scope
DT[, mycol, with=FALSE]  # revert to data.frame behavior
DT[[mycol]]               # treat DT as a list and use [[ from base R
```

See `?data.table` for more details about the `..` prefix.

The `with` argument takes its name from the `base` function `with()`. When `with=TRUE` (default), `data.table` operates similar to `with()`, i.e. `DT[, mycol]` behaves like `with(DT, mycol)`. When `with=FALSE`, the standard `data.frame` evaluation rules apply to all variables in `j` and you can no longer use column names directly.

## What are the benefits of being able to use column names as if they are variables inside `DT[...]`?

`j` doesn't have to be just column names. You can write any R _expression_ of column names directly in `j`, _e.g._, `DT[ , mean(x*y/z)]`.  The same applies to `i`, _e.g._, `DT[x>1000, sum(y*z)]`.

This runs the `j` expression on the set of rows where the `i` expression is true. You don't even need to return data, _e.g._, `DT[x>1000, plot(y, z)]`. You can do `j` by group simply by adding `by = `; e.g., `DT[x>1000, sum(y*z), by = w]`. This runs `j` for each group in column `w` but just over the rows where `x>1000`. By placing the 3 parts of the query (i=where, j=select and by=group by) inside the square brackets, data.table sees this query as a whole before any part of it is evaluated. Thus it can optimize the combined query for performance. It can do this because the R language uniquely has lazy evaluation (Python and Julia do not). data.table sees the expressions inside `DT[...]` before they are evaluated and optimizes them before evaluation. For example, if data.table see that you're only using 2 columns out of 100, it won't bother to subset the 98 that aren't needed by your j expression.

## OK, I'm starting to see what data.table is about, but why didn't you just enhance `data.frame` in R? Why does it have to be a new package?

As [highlighted above](#j-num), `j` in `[.data.table` is fundamentally different from `j` in `[.data.frame`. Even if something as simple as `DF[ , 1]` was changed in base R to return a data.frame rather than a vector, that would break existing code in many 1000's of CRAN packages and user code. As soon as we took the step to create a new class that inherited from data.frame, we had the opportunity to change a few things and we did. We want data.table to be slightly different and to work this way for more complicated syntax to work. There are other differences, too (see [below](#SmallerDiffs) ).

Furthermore, data.table _inherits_ from `data.frame`. It _is_ a `data.frame`, too. A data.table can be passed to any package that only accepts `data.frame` and that package can use `[.data.frame` syntax on the data.table. See [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/10529888/403310) for how that is achieved.

We _have_ proposed enhancements to R wherever possible, too. One of these was accepted as a new feature in R 2.12.0:

> `unique()` and `match()` are now faster on character vectors where all elements are in the global CHARSXP cache and have unmarked encoding (ASCII).  Thanks to Matt Dowle for suggesting improvements to the way the hash code is generated in unique.c.

A second proposal was to use `memcpy` in duplicate.c, which is much faster than a for loop in C. This would improve the _way_ that R copies data internally (on some measures by 13 times). The thread on r-devel is [here](https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2010-April/057249.html).

A third more significant proposal that was accepted is that R now uses data.table's radix sort code as from R 3.3.0:

> The radix sort algorithm and implementation from data.table (forder) replaces the previous radix (counting) sort and adds a new method for order(). Contributed by Matt Dowle and Arun Srinivasan, the new algorithm supports logical, integer (even with large values), real, and character vectors. It outperforms all other methods, but there are some caveats (see ?sort).

This was big event for us and we celebrated until the cows came home. (Not really.)

## Why are the defaults the way they are? Why does it work the way it does?

The simple answer is because the main author originally designed it for his own use. He wanted it that way. He finds it a more natural, faster way to write code, which also executes more quickly.

## Isn't this already done by `with()` and `subset()` in `base`?

Some of the features discussed so far are, yes. The package builds upon base functionality. It does the same sorts of things but with less code required and executes many times faster if used correctly.

## Why does `X[Y]` return all the columns from `Y` too? Shouldn't it return a subset of `X`?

This was changed in v1.5.3 (Feb 2011). Since then `X[Y]` includes `Y`'s non-join columns. We refer to this feature as _join inherited scope_ because not only are `X` columns available to the `j` expression, so are `Y` columns. The downside is that `X[Y]` is less efficient since every item of `Y`'s non-join columns are duplicated to match the (likely large) number of rows in `X` that match. We therefore strongly encourage `X[Y, j]` instead of `X[Y]`. See [next FAQ](#MergeDiff).

## What is the difference between `X[Y]` and `merge(X, Y)`? {#MergeDiff}

`X[Y]` is a join, looking up `X`'s rows using `Y` (or `Y`'s key if it has one) as an index.

`Y[X]` is a join, looking up `Y`'s rows using `X` (or `X`'s key if it has one) as an index.

`merge(X,Y)`[^1] does both ways at the same time. The number of rows of `X[Y]` and `Y[X]` usually differ, whereas the number of rows returned by `merge(X, Y)` and `merge(Y, X)` is the same.

_BUT_ that misses the main point. Most tasks require something to be done on the data after a join or merge. Why merge all the columns of data, only to use a small subset of them afterwards? You may suggest `merge(X[ , ColsNeeded1], Y[ , ColsNeeded2])`, but that requires the programmer to work out which columns are needed. `X[Y, j]` in data.table does all that in one step for you. When you write `X[Y, sum(foo*bar)]`, data.table automatically inspects the `j` expression to see which columns it uses.  It will subset those columns only; the others are ignored. Memory is only created for the columns `j` uses and `Y` columns enjoy standard R recycling rules within the context of each group. Let's say `foo` is in `X` and `bar` is in `Y` (along with 20 other columns in `Y`). Isn't `X[Y, sum(foo*bar)]` quicker to program and quicker to run than a `merge` of everything wastefully followed by a `subset`?

[^1]: Here we mean either the `merge` _method_ for data.table or the `merge` method for `data.frame` since both methods work in the same way in this respect. See `?merge.data.table` and [below](#r-dispatch) for more information about method dispatch.

## Anything else about `X[Y, sum(foo*bar)]`?

This behaviour changed in v1.9.4 (Sep 2014). It now does the `X[Y]` join and then runs `sum(foo*bar)` over all the rows; i.e., `X[Y][ , sum(foo*bar)]`. It used to run `j` for each _group_ of `X` that each row of `Y` matches to. That can still be done as it's very useful but you now need to be explicit and specify `by = .EACHI`, _i.e._, `X[Y, sum(foo*bar), by = .EACHI]`. We call this _grouping by each `i`_.

For example, (further complicating it by using _join inherited scope_, too):

```{r}
X = data.table(grp = c("a", "a", "b",
                       "b", "b", "c", "c"), foo = 1:7)
setkey(X, grp)
Y = data.table(c("b", "c"), bar = c(4, 2))
X
Y
X[Y, sum(foo*bar)]
X[Y, sum(foo*bar), by = .EACHI]
```

## That's nice. How did you manage to change it given that users depended on the old behaviour?

The request to change came from users. The feeling was that if a query is doing grouping then an explicit `by=` should be present for code readability reasons. An option was provided to return the old behaviour: `options(datatable.old.bywithoutby)`, by default `FALSE`. This enabled upgrading to test the other new features / bug fixes in v1.9.4, with later migration of any by-without-by queries when ready by adding `by=.EACHI` to them. We retained 47 pre-change tests and added them back as new tests, tested under `options(datatable.old.bywithoutby=TRUE)`. We added a startup message about the change and how to revert to the old behaviour. After 1 year the option was deprecated with warning when used. After 2 years the option to revert to old behaviour was removed.

Of the 66 packages on CRAN or Bioconductor that depended on or import data.table at the time of releasing v1.9.4 (it is now over 300), only one was affected by the change. That could be because many packages don't have comprehensive tests, or just that grouping by each row in `i` wasn't being used much by downstream packages. We always test the new version with all dependent packages before release and coordinate any changes with those maintainers. So this release was quite straightforward in that regard.

Another compelling reason to make the change was that previously, there was no efficient way to achieve what `X[Y, sum(foo*bar)]` does now. You had to write `X[Y][ , sum(foo*bar)]`. That was suboptimal because `X[Y]` joined all the columns and passed them all to the second compound query without knowing that only `foo` and `bar` are needed. To solve that efficiency problem, extra programming effort was required: `X[Y, list(foo, bar)][ , sum(foo*bar)]`.  The change to `by = .EACHI` has simplified this by allowing both queries to be expressed inside a single `DT[...]` query for efficiency.

# General Syntax

## How can I avoid writing a really long `j` expression? You've said that I should use the column _names_, but I've got a lot of columns.

When grouping, the `j` expression can use column names as variables, as you know, but it can also use a reserved symbol `.SD` which refers to the **S**ubset of the **D**ata.table for each group (excluding the grouping columns). So to sum up all your columns it's just `DT[ , lapply(.SD, sum), by = grp]`. It might seem tricky, but it's fast to write and fast to run. Notice you don't have to create an anonymous function. The `.SD` object is efficiently implemented internally and more efficient than passing an argument to a function. But if the `.SD` symbol appears in `j` then data.table has to populate `.SD` fully for each group even if `j` doesn't use all of it.

So please don't do, for example, `DT[ , sum(.SD[["sales"]]), by = grp]`. That works but is inefficient and inelegant. `DT[ , sum(sales), by = grp]` is what was intended, and it could be 100s of times faster. If you use _all_ of the data in `.SD` for each group (such as in `DT[ , lapply(.SD, sum), by = grp]`) then that's very good usage of `.SD`. If you're using _several_ but not _all_ of the columns, you can combine `.SD` with `.SDcols`; see `?data.table`.

## Why is the default for `mult` now `"all"`?

In v1.5.3 the default was changed to `"all"`. When `i` (or `i`'s key if it has one) has fewer columns than `x`'s key, `mult` was already set to `"all"` automatically. Changing the default makes this clearer and easier for users as it came up quite often.

In versions up to v1.3, `"all"` was slower. Internally, `"all"` was implemented by joining using `"first"`, then again from scratch using `"last"`, after which a diff between them was performed to work out the span of the matches in `x` for each row in `i`. Most often we join to single rows, though, where `"first"`,`"last"` and `"all"` return the same result. We preferred maximum performance for the majority of situations so the default chosen was `"first"`. When working with a non-unique key (generally a single column containing a grouping variable), `DT["A"]` returned the first row of that group so `DT["A", mult = "all"]` was needed to return all the rows in that group.

In v1.4 the binary search in C was changed to branch at the deepest level to find first and last. That branch will likely occur within the same final pages of RAM so there should no longer be a speed disadvantage in defaulting `mult` to `"all"`. We warned that the default might change and made the change in v1.5.3.

A future version of data.table may allow a distinction between a key and a _unique key_. Internally `mult = "all"` would perform more like `mult = "first"` when all `x`'s key columns were joined to and `x`'s key was a unique key. data.table would need checks on insert and update to make sure a unique key is maintained. An advantage of specifying a unique key would be that data.table would ensure no duplicates could be inserted, in addition to performance.

## I'm using `c()` in `j` and getting strange results.

This is a common source of confusion. In `data.frame` you are used to, for example:

```{r}
DF = data.frame(x = 1:3, y = 4:6, z = 7:9)
DF
DF[ , c("y", "z")]
```

which returns the two columns. In data.table you know you can use the column names directly and might try:

```{r}
DT = data.table(DF)
DT[ , c(y, z)]
```

but this returns one vector.  Remember that the `j` expression is evaluated within the environment of `DT` and `c()` returns a vector.  If 2 or more columns are required, use `list()` or `.()` instead:

```{r}
DT[ , .(y, z)]
```

`c()` can be useful in a data.table too, but its behaviour is different from that in `[.data.frame`.

## I have built up a complex table with many columns.  I want to use it as a template for a new table; _i.e._, create a new table with no rows, but with the column names and types copied from my table. Can I do that easily?

Yes. If your complex table is called `DT`, try `NEWDT = DT[0]`.

## Is a null data.table the same as `DT[0]`?

No. By "null data.table" we mean the result of `data.table(NULL)` or `as.data.table(NULL)`; _i.e._,

```{r}
data.table(NULL)
data.frame(NULL)
as.data.table(NULL)
as.data.frame(NULL)
is.null(data.table(NULL))
is.null(data.frame(NULL))
```

The null data.table|`frame` is `NULL` with some attributes attached, which means it's no longer `NULL`. In R only pure `NULL` is `NULL` as tested by `is.null()`. When referring to the "null data.table" we use lower case null to help distinguish from upper case `NULL`. To test for the null data.table, use `length(DT) == 0` or `ncol(DT) == 0` (`length` is slightly faster as it's a primitive function).

An _empty_ data.table (`DT[0]`) has one or more columns, all of which are empty. Those empty columns still have names and types.

```{r}
DT = data.table(a = 1:3, b = c(4, 5, 6), d = c(7L,8L,9L))
DT[0]
sapply(DT[0], class)
```

## Why has the `DT()` alias been removed? {#DTremove1}
`DT` was introduced originally as a wrapper for a list of `j `expressions. Since `DT` was an alias for data.table, this was a convenient way to take care of silent recycling in cases where each item of the `j` list evaluated to different lengths. The alias was one reason grouping was slow, though.

As of v1.3, `list()` or `.()` should be passed instead to the `j` argument. These are much faster, especially when there are many groups. Internally, this was a non-trivial change. Vector recycling is now done internally, along with several other speed enhancements for grouping.

## But my code uses `j = DT(...)` and it works. The previous FAQ says that `DT()` has been removed. {#DTremove2}

Then you are using a version prior to 1.5.3. Prior to 1.5.3 `[.data.table` detected use of `DT()` in the `j` and automatically replaced it with a call to `list()`. This was to help the transition for existing users.

## What are the scoping rules for `j` expressions?

Think of the subset as an environment where all the column names are variables. When a variable `foo` is used in the `j` of a query such as `X[Y, sum(foo)]`, `foo` is looked for in the following order:

 1. The scope of `X`'s subset; _i.e._, `X`'s column names.
 2. The scope of each row of `Y`; _i.e._, `Y`'s column names (_join inherited scope_)
 3. The scope of the calling frame; _e.g._, the line that appears before the data.table query.
 4. Exercise for reader: does it then ripple up the calling frames, or go straight to `globalenv()`?
 5. The global environment

This is _lexical scoping_ as explained in [R FAQ 3.3.1](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html#Lexical-scoping). The environment in which the function was created is not relevant, though, because there is _no function_. No anonymous _function_ is passed to `j`. Instead, an anonymous _body_ is passed to `j`; for example,

```{r}
DT = data.table(x = rep(c("a", "b"), c(2, 3)), y = 1:5)
DT
DT[ , {z = sum(y); z + 3}, by = x]
```

Some programming languages call this a _lambda_.

## Can I trace the `j` expression as it runs through the groups? {#j-trace}

Try something like this:

```{r}
DT[ , {
  cat("Objects:", paste(objects(), collapse = ","), "\n")
  cat("Trace: x=", as.character(x), " y=", y, "\n")
  sum(y)},
  by = x]
```

## Inside each group, why are the group variables length-1?

[Above](#j-trace), `x` is a grouping variable and (as from v1.6.1) has `length` 1 (if inspected or used in `j`). It's for efficiency and convenience. Therefore, there is no difference between the following two statements:

```{r}
DT[ , .(g = 1, h = 2, i = 3, j = 4, repeatgroupname = x, sum(y)), by = x]
DT[ , .(g = 1, h = 2, i = 3, j = 4, repeatgroupname = x[1], sum(y)), by = x]
```

If you need the size of the current group, use `.N` rather than calling `length()` on any column.

## Only the first 10 rows are printed, how do I print more?

There are two things happening here. First, if the number of rows in a data.table are large (`> 100` by default), then a summary of the data.table is printed to the console by default. Second, the summary of a large data.table is printed by taking the top and bottom `n` (`= 5` by default) rows of the data.table and only printing those. Both of these parameters (when to trigger a summary and how much of a table to use as a summary) are configurable by R's `options` mechanism, or by calling the `print` function directly.

For instance, to enforce the summary of a data.table to only happen when a data.table is greater than 50 rows, you could `options(datatable.print.nrows = 50)`. To disable the summary-by-default completely, you could `options(datatable.print.nrows = Inf)`. You could also call `print` directly, as in `print(your.data.table, nrows = Inf)`.

If you want to show more than just the top (and bottom) 10 rows of a data.table summary (say you like 20), set `options(datatable.print.topn = 20)`, for example. Again, you could also just call `print` directly, as in `print(your.data.table, topn = 20)`.

## With an `X[Y]` join, what if `X` contains a column called `"Y"`?

When `i` is a single name such as `Y` it is evaluated in the calling frame. In all other cases such as calls to `.()` or other expressions, `i` is evaluated within the scope of `X`. This facilitates easy _self-joins_ such as `X[J(unique(colA)), mult = "first"]`.

## `X[Z[Y]]` is failing because `X` contains a column `"Y"`. I'd like it to use the table `Y` in calling scope.

The `Z[Y]` part is not a single name so that is evaluated within the frame of `X` and the problem occurs. Try `tmp = Z[Y]; X[tmp]`. This is robust to `X` containing a column `"tmp"` because `tmp` is a single name. If you often encounter conflicts of this type, one simple solution may be to name all tables in uppercase and all column names in lowercase, or some similar scheme.

## Can you explain further why data.table is inspired by `A[B]` syntax in `base`?

Consider `A[B]` syntax using an example matrix `A`:
```{r}
A = matrix(1:12, nrow = 4)
A
```

To obtain cells `(1, 2) = 5` and `(3, 3) = 11` many users (we believe) may try this first:
```{r}
A[c(1, 3), c(2, 3)]
```

However, this returns the union of those rows and columns. To reference the cells, a 2-column matrix is required. `?Extract` says:

> When indexing arrays by `[` a single argument `i` can be a matrix with as many columns as there are dimensions of `x`; the result is then a vector with elements corresponding to the sets of indices in each row of `i`.

Let's try again.

```{r}
B = cbind(c(1, 3), c(2, 3))
B
A[B]
```

A matrix is a 2-dimensional structure with row names and column names. Can we do the same with names?

```{r}
rownames(A) = letters[1:4]
colnames(A) = LETTERS[1:3]
A
B = cbind(c("a", "c"), c("B", "C"))
A[B]
```

So yes, we can. Can we do the same with a `data.frame`?

```{r}
A = data.frame(A = 1:4, B = letters[11:14], C = pi*1:4)
rownames(A) = letters[1:4]
A
B
A[B]
```

But, notice that the result was coerced to `character.` R coerced `A` to `matrix` first so that the syntax could work, but the result isn't ideal.  Let's try making `B` a `data.frame`.

```{r}
B = data.frame(c("a", "c"), c("B", "C"))
cat(try(A[B], silent = TRUE))
```

So we can't subset a `data.frame` by a `data.frame` in base R. What if we want row names and column names that aren't `character` but `integer` or `float`? What if we want more than 2 dimensions of mixed types? Enter data.table.

Furthermore, matrices, especially sparse matrices, are often stored in a 3-column tuple: `(i, j, value)`. This can be thought of as a key-value pair where `i` and `j` form a 2-column key. If we have more than one value, perhaps of different types, it might look like `(i, j, val1, val2, val3, ...)`. This looks very much like a `data.frame`. Hence data.table extends `data.frame` so that a `data.frame` `X` can be subset by a `data.frame` `Y`, leading to the `X[Y]` syntax.

## Can base be changed to do this then, rather than a new package?
`data.frame` is used _everywhere_ and so it is very difficult to make _any_ changes to it.
data.table _inherits_ from `data.frame`. It _is_ a `data.frame`, too. A data.table _can_ be passed to any package that _only_ accepts `data.frame`. When that package uses `[.data.frame` syntax on the data.table, it works. It works because `[.data.table` looks to see where it was called from. If it was called from such a package, `[.data.table` diverts to `[.data.frame`.

## I've heard that data.table syntax is analogous to SQL.
Yes:

 - `i`  $\Leftrightarrow$ where
 - `j`  $\Leftrightarrow$  select
 - `:=`  $\Leftrightarrow$  update
 - `by`  $\Leftrightarrow$  group by
 - `i`  $\Leftrightarrow$  order by (in compound syntax)
 - `i`  $\Leftrightarrow$  having (in compound syntax)
 - `nomatch = NA`  $\Leftrightarrow$  outer join
 - `nomatch = NULL`  $\Leftrightarrow$  inner join
 - `mult = "first"|"last"`  $\Leftrightarrow$  N/A because SQL is inherently unordered
 - `roll = TRUE`  $\Leftrightarrow$  N/A because SQL is inherently unordered

The general form is:

```r
DT[where, select|update, group by][order by][...] ... [...]
```

A key advantage of column vectors in R is that they are _ordered_, unlike SQL[^2]. We can use ordered functions in `data.table` queries such as `diff()` and we can use _any_ R function from any package, not just the functions that are defined in SQL. A disadvantage is that R objects must fit in memory, but with several R packages such as `ff`, `bigmemory`, `mmap` and `indexing`, this is changing.

[^2]: It may be a surprise to learn that `select top 10 * from ...` does _not_ reliably return the same rows over time in SQL. You do need to include an `order by` clause, or use a clustered index to guarantee row order; _i.e._, SQL is inherently unordered.

## What are the smaller syntax differences between `data.frame` and data.table {#SmallerDiffs}

 - `DT[3]` refers to the 3rd _row_, but `DF[3]` refers to the 3rd _column_
 - `DT[3, ] == DT[3]`, but `DF[ , 3] == DF[3]` (somewhat confusingly in data.frame, whereas data.table is consistent)
 - For this reason we say the comma is _optional_ in `DT`, but not optional in `DF`
 - `DT[[3]] == DF[, 3] == DF[[3]]`
 - `DT[i, ]`, where `i` is a single integer, returns a single row, just like `DF[i, ]`, but unlike a matrix single-row subset which returns a vector.
 - `DT[ , j]` where `j` is a single integer returns a one-column data.table, unlike `DF[, j]` which returns a vector by default
 - `DT[ , "colA"][[1]] == DF[ , "colA"]`.
 - `DT[ , colA] == DF[ , "colA"]` (currently in data.table v1.9.8 but is about to change, see release notes)
 - `DT[ , list(colA)] == DF[ , "colA", drop = FALSE]`
 - `DT[NA]` returns 1 row of `NA`, but `DF[NA]` returns an entire copy of `DF` containing `NA` throughout. The symbol `NA` is type `logical` in R and is therefore recycled by `[.data.frame`. The user's intention was probably `DF[NA_integer_]`. `[.data.table` diverts to this probable intention automatically, for convenience.
 - `DT[c(TRUE, NA, FALSE)]` treats the `NA` as `FALSE`, but `DF[c(TRUE, NA, FALSE)]` returns
  `NA` rows for each `NA`
 - `DT[ColA == ColB]` is simpler than `DF[!is.na(ColA) & !is.na(ColB) & ColA == ColB, ]`
 - `data.frame(list(1:2, "k", 1:4))` creates 3 columns, data.table creates one `list` column.
 - `check.names` is by default `TRUE` in `data.frame` but `FALSE` in data.table, for convenience.
 - `data.table` has always set `stringsAsFactors=FALSE` by default. In R 4.0.0 (Apr 2020), `data.frame`'s default was changed from `TRUE` to `FALSE` and there is no longer a difference in this regard; see [stringsAsFactors, Kurt Hornik, Feb 2020](https://developer.r-project.org/Blog/public/2020/02/16/stringsasfactors/).
 - Atomic vectors in `list` columns are collapsed when printed using `", "` in `data.frame`, but `","` in data.table with a trailing comma after the 6th item to avoid accidental printing of large embedded objects.
 - Unlike data.frames a data.table cannot store rows with no columns, as rows are considered to be the children of columns: `nrow(DF[, 0])` returns the number of rows, while `nrow(DT[, 0])` always returns 0; but see issue [#2422](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/2422).

In `[.data.frame` we very often set `drop = FALSE`. When we forget, bugs can arise in edge cases where single columns are selected and all of a sudden a vector is returned rather than a single column `data.frame`. In `[.data.table` we took the opportunity to make it consistent and dropped `drop`.

When a data.table is passed to a data.table-unaware package, that package is not concerned with any of these differences; it just works.

## I'm using `j` for its side effect only, but I'm still getting data returned. How do I stop that?

In this case `j` can be wrapped with `invisible()`; e.g., `DT[ , invisible(hist(colB)), by = colA]`[^3]

[^3]: _e.g._, `hist()` returns the breakpoints in addition to plotting to the graphics device.

## Why does `[.data.table` now have a `drop` argument from v1.5?

So that data.table can inherit from `data.frame` without using `...`. If we used `...` then invalid argument names would not be caught.

The `drop` argument is never used by `[.data.table`. It is a placeholder for non-data.table-aware packages when they use the `[.data.frame` syntax directly on a data.table.

## Rolling joins are cool and very fast! Was that hard to program?
The prevailing row on or before the `i` row is the final row the binary search tests anyway. So `roll = TRUE` is essentially just a switch in the binary search C code to return that row.

## Why does `DT[i, col := value]` return the whole of `DT`? I expected either no visible value (consistent with `<-`), or a message or return value containing how many rows were updated. It isn't obvious that the data has indeed been updated by reference.

This has changed in v1.8.3 to meet your expectations. Please upgrade.

The whole of `DT` is returned (now invisibly) so that compound syntax can work; _e.g._, `DT[i, done := TRUE][ , sum(done)]`. The number of rows updated is returned when `verbose` is `TRUE`, either on a per-query basis or globally using `options(datatable.verbose = TRUE)`.

## OK, thanks. What was so difficult about the result of `DT[i, col := value]` being returned invisibly?
R internally forces visibility on for `[`. The value of FunTab's eval column (see [src/main/names.c](https://github.com/wch/r-source/blob/trunk/src/main/names.c)) for `[` is `0` meaning "force `R_Visible` on" (see [R-Internals section 1.6](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-ints.html#Autoprinting) ). Therefore, when we tried `invisible()` or setting `R_Visible` to `0` directly ourselves, `eval` in [src/main/eval.c](https://github.com/wch/r-source/blob/trunk/src/main/eval.c) would force it on again.

To solve this problem, the key was to stop trying to stop the print method running after a `:=`. Instead, inside `:=` we now (from v1.8.3) set a global flag which the print method uses to know whether to actually print or not.

## Why do I have to type `DT` sometimes twice after using `:=` to print the result to console?

This is an unfortunate downside to get [#869](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/869) to work. If a `:=` is used inside a function with no `DT[]` before the end of the function, then the next time `DT` is typed at the prompt, nothing will be printed. A repeated `DT` will print. To avoid this: include a `DT[]` after the last `:=` in your function. If that is not possible (e.g., it's not a function you can change) then `print(DT)` and `DT[]` at the prompt are guaranteed to print. As before, adding an extra `[]` on the end of `:=` query is a recommended idiom to update and then print; e.g.> `DT[,foo:=3L][]`.

## I've noticed that `base::cbind.data.frame` (and `base::rbind.data.frame`) appear to be changed by data.table. How is this possible? Why?

It was a temporary, last resort solution before rbind and cbind S3 method dispatch was fixed in R >= 4.0.0. Essentially, the issue was that `data.table` inherits from `data.frame`, _and_ `base::cbind` and `base::rbind` (uniquely) do their own S3 dispatch internally as documented by `?cbind`. The `data.table` workaround was adding one `for` loop to the start of each function directly in `base`. That modification was made dynamically, _i.e._, the `base` definition of `cbind.data.frame` was fetched, the `for` loop added to the beginning, and then assigned back to `base`. This solution was designed to be robust to different definitions of `base::cbind.data.frame` in different versions of R, including unknown future changes. It worked well. The competing requirements were:

 - `cbind(DT, DF)` needs to work. Defining `cbind.data.table` didn't work because `base::cbind` does its own S3 dispatch and required (before R 4.0.0) that the _first_ `cbind` method for each object it is passed is _identical_. This is not true in `cbind(DT, DF)` because the first method for `DT` is `cbind.data.table` but the first method for `DF` is `cbind.data.frame`. `base::cbind` then fell through to its internal `bind` code which appears to treat `DT` as a regular `list` and returns very odd looking and unusable `matrix` output. See [below](#cbinderror). We cannot just advise users not to call `cbind(DT, DF)` because packages such as `ggplot2` make such a call ([test 167.2](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/blob/master/inst/tests/tests.Rraw#L444-L447)).

 - This naturally led to trying to mask `cbind.data.frame` instead. Since a data.table is a `data.frame`, `cbind` would find the same method for both `DT` and `DF`. However, this didn't work either because `base::cbind` appears to find methods in `base` first; _i.e._, `base::cbind.data.frame` isn't maskable.

 - Finally, we tried masking `cbind` itself (v1.6.5 and v1.6.6). This allowed `cbind(DT, DF)` to work, but introduced compatibility issues with package `IRanges`, since `IRanges` also masks `cbind`. It worked if `IRanges` was lower on the `search()` path than data.table, but if `IRanges` was higher then data.table's, `cbind` would never be called and the strange-looking `matrix` output occurs again (see [below](#cbinderror)).

Many thanks to the R core team for fixing the issue in Sep 2019. data.table v1.12.6+ no longer applies the workaround in R >= 4.0.0.

## I've read about method dispatch (_e.g._ `merge` may or may not dispatch to `merge.data.table`) but _how_ does R know how to dispatch? Are dots significant or special? How on earth does R know which function to dispatch and when? {#r-dispatch}

This comes up quite a lot but it's really earth-shatteringly simple. A function such as `merge` is _generic_ if it consists of a call to `UseMethod`. When you see people talking about whether or not functions are _generic_ functions they are merely typing the function without `()` afterwards, looking at the program code inside it and if they see a call to `UseMethod` then it is _generic_.  What does `UseMethod` do? It literally slaps the function name together with the class of the first argument, separated by period (`.`) and then calls that function, passing along the same arguments. It's that simple. For example, `merge(X, Y)` contains a `UseMethod` call which means it then _dispatches_ (i.e. calls) `paste("merge", class(X), sep = ".")`. Functions with dots in their name may or may not be methods. The dot is irrelevant really, other than dot being the separator that `UseMethod` uses. Knowing this background should now highlight why, for example, it is obvious to R folk that `as.data.table.data.frame`  is the `data.frame` method for the `as.data.table` generic function. Further, it may help to elucidate that, yes, you are correct, it is not obvious from its name alone that `ls.fit` is not the fit method of the `ls` generic function. You only know that by typing `ls` (not `ls()`) and observing it isn't a single call to `UseMethod`.

You might now ask: where is this documented in R? Answer: it's quite clear, but, you need to first know to look in `?UseMethod` and _that_ help file contains:

> When a function calling `UseMethod('fun')` is applied to an object with class attribute `c('first', 'second')`, the system searches for a function called `fun.first` and, if it finds it, applies it to the object. If no such function is found a function called `fun.second` is tried. If no class name produces a suitable function, the function `fun.default` is used, if it exists, or an error results.

Happily, an internet search for "How does R method dispatch work" (at the time of this writing) returns the `?UseMethod` help page in the top few links. Admittedly, other links rapidly descend into the intricacies of S3 vs S4, internal generics and so on.

However, features like basic S3 dispatch (pasting the function name together with the class name) is why some R folk love R. It's so simple. No complicated registration or signature is required. There isn't much needed to learn. To create the `merge` method for data.table all that was required, literally, was to merely create a function called `merge.data.table`.

# Questions relating to compute time

## I have 20 columns and a large number of rows. Why is an expression of one column so quick?

Several reasons:

 - Only that column is grouped, the other 19 are ignored because data.table inspects the `j` expression and realises it doesn't use the other columns.
 - One memory allocation is made for the largest group only, then that memory is re-used for the other groups. There is very little garbage to collect.
 - R is an in-memory column store; i.e., the columns are contiguous in RAM. Page fetches from RAM into L2 cache are minimised.

## I don't have a `key` on a large table, but grouping is still really quick. Why is that?

data.table uses radix sorting. This is significantly faster than other sort algorithms. See [our presentations](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/wiki/Presentations) for more information, in particular from useR!2015 Denmark.

This is also one reason why `setkey()` is quick.

When no `key` is set, or we group in a different order from that of the key, we call it an _ad hoc_ `by`.

## Why is grouping by columns in the key faster than an _ad hoc_ `by`?

Because each group is contiguous in RAM, thereby minimising page fetches and memory can be
copied in bulk (`memcpy` in C) rather than looping in C.

## What are primary and secondary indexes in data.table?

Manual: [`?setkey`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/data.table/functions/setkey)
S.O.: [What is the purpose of setting a key in data.table?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20039335/what-is-the-purpose-of-setting-a-key-in-data-table/20057411#20057411)

`setkey(DT, col1, col2)` orders the rows by column `col1` then within each group of `col1` it orders by `col2`. This is a _primary index_. The row order is changed _by reference_ in RAM. Subsequent joins and groups on those key columns then take advantage of the sort order for efficiency. (Imagine how difficult looking for a phone number in a printed telephone directory would be if it wasn't sorted by surname then forename. That's literally all `setkey` does. It sorts the rows by the columns you specify.) The index doesn't use any RAM. It simply changes the row order in RAM and marks the key columns. Analogous to a _clustered index_ in SQL.

However, you can only have one primary key because data can only be physically sorted in RAM in one way at a time. Choose the primary index to be the one you use most often (e.g. `[id,date]`). Sometimes there isn't an obvious choice for the primary key or you need to join and group many different columns in different orders. Enter a secondary index. This does use memory (`4*nrow` bytes regardless of the number of columns in the index) to store the order of the rows by the columns you specify, but doesn't actually reorder the rows in RAM. Subsequent joins and groups take advantage of the secondary key's order but need to _hop_ via that index so aren't as efficient as primary indexes. But still, a lot faster than a full vector scan. There is no limit to the number of secondary indexes since each one is just a different ordering vector. Typically you don't need to create secondary indexes. They are created automatically and used for you automatically by using data.table normally; _e.g._ `DT[someCol == someVal, ]` and `DT[someCol %in% someVals, ]` will create, attach and then use the secondary index. This is faster in data.table than a vector scan so automatic indexing is on by default since there is no up-front penalty. There is an option to turn off automatic indexing; _e.g._, if somehow many indexes are being created and even the relatively small amount of extra memory becomes too large.

We use the words _index_ and _key_ interchangeably.

# Error messages
## "Could not find function `DT`"
See above [here](#DTremove1) and [here](#DTremove2).

## "unused argument(s) (`MySum = sum(v)`)"

This error is generated by `DT[ , MySum = sum(v)]`. `DT[ , .(MySum = sum(v))]` was intended, or `DT[ , j = .(MySum = sum(v))]`.

## "`translateCharUTF8` must be called on a `CHARSXP`"
This error (and similar, _e.g._, "`getCharCE` must be called on a `CHARSXP`") may be nothing do with character data or locale. Instead, this can be a symptom of an earlier memory corruption. To date these have been reproducible and fixed (quickly). Please report it to our [issues tracker](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues).

## `cbind(DT, DF)` returns a strange format, _e.g._ `Integer,5` {#cbinderror}

This occurs prior to v1.6.5, for `rbind(DT, DF)` too. Please upgrade to v1.6.7 or later.

## "cannot change value of locked binding for `.SD`"

`.SD` is locked by design. See `?data.table`. If you'd like to manipulate `.SD` before using it, or returning it, and don't wish to modify `DT` using `:=`, then take a copy first (see `?copy`), _e.g._,

```{r}
DT = data.table(a = rep(1:3, 1:3), b = 1:6, c = 7:12)
DT
DT[ , { mySD = copy(.SD)
      mySD[1, b := 99L]
      mySD},
    by = a]
```

## "cannot change value of locked binding for `.N`"

Please upgrade to v1.8.1 or later. From this version, if `.N` is returned by `j` it is renamed to `N` to avoid any ambiguity in any subsequent grouping between the `.N` special variable and a column called `".N"`.

The old behaviour can be reproduced by forcing `.N` to be called `.N`, like this:
```{r}
DT = data.table(a = c(1,1,2,2,2), b = c(1,2,2,2,1))
DT
DT[ , list(.N = .N), list(a, b)]   # show intermediate result for exposition
cat(try(
    DT[ , list(.N = .N), by = list(a, b)][ , unique(.N), by = a]   # compound query more typical
, silent = TRUE))
```

If you are already running v1.8.1 or later then the error message is now more helpful than the "cannot change value of locked binding" error, as you can see above, since this vignette was produced using v1.8.1 or later.

The more natural syntax now works:
```{r}
if (packageVersion("data.table") >= "1.8.1") {
    DT[ , .N, by = list(a, b)][ , unique(N), by = a]
  }
if (packageVersion("data.table") >= "1.9.3") {
    DT[ , .N, by = .(a, b)][ , unique(N), by = a]   # same
}
```

# Warning messages
## "The following object(s) are masked from `package:base`: `cbind`, `rbind`"

This warning was present in v1.6.5 and v.1.6.6 only, when loading the package. The motivation was to allow `cbind(DT, DF)` to work, but as it transpired, this broke (full) compatibility with package `IRanges`. Please upgrade to v1.6.7 or later.

## "Coerced numeric RHS to integer to match the column's type"

Hopefully, this is self explanatory. The full message is:

Coerced numeric RHS to integer to match the column's type; may have truncated precision. Either change the column to numeric first by creating a new numeric vector length 5 (nrows of entire table) yourself and assigning that (i.e. 'replace' column), or coerce RHS to integer yourself (e.g. 1L or as.integer) to make your intent clear (and for speed). Or, set the column type correctly up front when you create the table and stick to it, please.


To generate it, try:

```{r}
DT = data.table(a = 1:5, b = 1:5)
suppressWarnings(
DT[2, b := 6]         # works (slower) with warning
)
class(6)              # numeric not integer
DT[2, b := 7L]        # works (faster) without warning
class(7L)             # L makes it an integer
DT[ , b := rnorm(5)]  # 'replace' integer column with a numeric column
```

## Reading data.table from RDS or RData file

`*.RDS` and `*.RData` are file types which can store in-memory R objects on disk efficiently. However, storing data.table into the binary file loses its column over-allocation. This isn't a big deal -- your data.table will be copied in memory on the next _by reference_ operation and throw a warning. Therefore it is recommended to call `setalloccol()` on each data.table loaded with `readRDS()` or `load()` calls.

# General questions about the package

## v1.3 appears to be missing from the CRAN archive?
That is correct. v1.3 was available on R-Forge only. There were several large
changes internally and these took some time to test in development.

## Is data.table compatible with S-plus?

Not currently.

 - A few core parts of the package are written in C and use internal R functions and R structures.
 - The package uses lexical scoping which is one of the differences between R and **S-plus** explained by [R FAQ 3.3.1](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html#Lexical-scoping)

## Is it available for Linux, Mac and Windows?
Yes, for both 32-bit and 64-bit on all platforms. Thanks to CRAN. There are no special or OS-specific libraries used.

## I think it's great. What can I do?
Please file suggestions, bug reports and enhancement requests on our [issues tracker](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues). This helps make the package better.

Please do star the package on [GitHub](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/wiki). This helps encourage the developers and helps other R users find the package.

You can submit pull requests to change the code and/or documentation yourself; see our [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## I think it's not great. How do I warn others about my experience?

We add all articles we know about (whether positive or negative) to the [Articles](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/wiki/Articles) page. All pages in the project's wiki on GitHub are open-access with no modify restrictions. Feel free to write an article, link to a negative one someone else wrote that you found, or add a new page to our wiki to collect your criticisms. Please make it constructive so we have a chance to improve.

## I have a question. I know the r-help posting guide tells me to contact the maintainer (not r-help), but is there a larger group of people I can ask?
Please see the [support guide](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/wiki/Support) on the project's homepage which contains up-to-date links.

## Where are the datatable-help archives?
The [homepage](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/wiki) contains links to the archives in several formats.

## I'd prefer not to post on the Issues page, can I mail just one or two people privately?
Sure. You're more likely to get a faster answer from the Issues page or Stack Overflow, though. Further, asking publicly in those places helps build the general knowledge base.

## I have created a package that uses data.table. How do I ensure my package is data.table-aware so that inheritance from `data.frame` works?

Please see [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/10529888/403310).

<p>The first section, Beginner FAQs, is intended to be read in order, from start to finish.  Itâ€™s just written in a FAQ style to be digested more easily. It isnâ€™t really the most frequently asked questions. A better measure for that is looking on Stack Overflow.</p>
<p>This FAQ is required reading and considered core documentation. Please do not ask questions on Stack Overflow or raise issues on GitHub until you have read it. We can all tell when you ask that you havenâ€™t read it. So if you do ask and havenâ€™t read it, donâ€™t use your real name.</p>
<p>This document has been quickly revised given the changes in v1.9.8 released Nov 2016. Please do submit pull requests to fix mistakes or improvements.  If anyone knows why the table of contents comes out so narrow and squashed when displayed by CRAN, please let us know.  This document used to be a PDF and we changed it recently to HTML.</p>
<h1 id="beginner-faqs"><span class="section-number">1.</span> Beginner FAQs</h1>
<h2 id="j-num"><span class="section-number">1.1</span> Why do <code>DT[ , 5]</code> and <code>DT[2, 5]</code> return a 1-column data.table rather than vectors like <code>data.frame</code>?</h2>
<p>For consistency so that when you use data.table in functions that accept varying inputs, you can rely on <code>DT[...]</code> returning a data.table. You donâ€™t have to remember to include <code>drop=FALSE</code> like you do in data.frame. data.table was first released in 2006 and this difference to data.frame has been a feature since the very beginning.</p>
<p>You may have heard that it is generally bad practice to refer to columns by number rather than name, though. If your colleague comes along and reads your code later they may have to hunt around to find out which column is number 5. If you or they change the column ordering higher up in your R program, you may produce wrong results with no warning or error if you forget to change all the places in your code which refer to column number 5. That is your fault not Râ€™s or data.tableâ€™s. Itâ€™s really really bad. Please donâ€™t do it. Itâ€™s the same mantra as professional SQL developers have: never use <code>select *</code>, always explicitly select by column name to at least try to be robust to future changes.</p>
<p>Say column 5 is named <code>&quot;region&quot;</code> and you really must extract that column as a vector not a data.table. It is more robust to use the column name and write <code>DT$region</code> or <code>DT[[&quot;region&quot;]]</code>; i.e., the same as base R. Using base Râ€™s <code>$</code> and <code>[[</code> on data.table is encouraged. Not when combined with <code>&lt;-</code> to assign (use <code>:=</code> instead for that) but just to select a single column by name they are encouraged.</p>
<p>There are some circumstances where referring to a column by number seems like the only way, such as a sequence of columns. In these situations just like data.frame, you can write <code>DT[, 5:10]</code> and <code>DT[,c(1,4,10)]</code>. However, again, it is more robust (to future changes in your dataâ€™s number of and ordering of columns) to use a named range such as <code>DT[,columnRed:columnViolet]</code> or name each one <code>DT[,c(&quot;columnRed&quot;,&quot;columnOrange&quot;,&quot;columnYellow&quot;)]</code>. It is harder work up front, but you will probably thank yourself and your colleagues might thank you in the future. At least you can say you tried your best to write robust code if something does go wrong.</p>
<p>However, what we really want you to do is <code>DT[,.(columnRed,columnOrange,columnYellow)]</code>; i.e., use column names as if they are variables directly inside <code>DT[...]</code>. You donâ€™t have to prefix each column with <code>DT$</code> like you do in data.frame. The <code>.()</code> part is just an alias for <code>list()</code> and you can use <code>list()</code> instead if you prefer. You can place any R expression of column names, using any R package, returning different types of different lengths, right there. We wanted to encourage you to do that so strongly in the past that we deliberately didnâ€™t make <code>DT[,5]</code> work at all. Before v1.9.8 released Nov 2016, <code>DT[,5]</code> used to just return <code>5</code>. The thinking was that we could more simply teach one fact that the parts inside <code>DT[...]</code> get evaluated within the frame of DT always (they see column names as if they are variables). And <code>5</code> evaluates to <code>5</code> so that behaviour was consistent with the single rule. We asked you to go through an extra deliberate hurdle <code>DT[,5,with=FALSE]</code> if you really wanted to select a column by name or number. Going forward from Nov 2016, you donâ€™t need to use <code>with=FALSE</code> and weâ€™ll see how greater consistency with data.frame in this regard will help or hinder both new and long-time users. The new users who donâ€™t read this FAQ, not even this very first entry, will hopefully not stumble as soon with data.table as they did before if they had expected it to work like data.frame. Hopefully they will not miss out on understanding our intent and recommendation to place expressions of columns inside <code>DT[i, j, by]</code>. If they use data.table like data.frame they wonâ€™t gain any benefits. If you know anyone like that, please give them a friendly nudge to read this document like you are.</p>
<p>Reminder: you can place <em>any</em> R expression inside <code>DT[...]</code> using column names as if they are variables; e.g., try <code>DT[, colA*colB/2]</code>. That does return a vector because you used column names as if they are variables. Wrap with <code>.()</code> to return a data.table; i.e. <code>DT[,.(colA*colB/2)]</code>.  Name it: <code>DT[,.(myResult = colA*colB/2)]</code>.  And weâ€™ll leave it to you to guess how to return two things from this query. Itâ€™s also quite common to do a bunch of things inside an anonymous body: <code>DT[, { x&lt;-colA+10; x*x/2 }]</code> or call another packageâ€™s function: <code>DT[ , fitdistr(columnA, &quot;normal&quot;)]</code>.</p>
<h2 id="why-does-dt-quot-region-quot-return-a-1-column-data-table-rather-than-a-vector"><span class="section-number">1.2</span> Why does <code>DT[,&quot;region&quot;]</code> return a 1-column data.table rather than a vector?</h2>
<p>See the <a href="#j-num">answer above</a>. Try <code>DT$region</code> instead. Or <code>DT[[&quot;region&quot;]]</code>.</p>
<h2 id="why-does-dt-region-return-a-vector-for-the-region-column-i-d-like-a-1-column-data-table"><span class="section-number">1.3</span> Why does <code>DT[, region]</code> return a vector for the â€œregionâ€ column?  Iâ€™d like a 1-column data.table.</h2>
<p>Try <code>DT[ , .(region)]</code> instead. <code>.()</code> is an alias for <code>list()</code> and ensures a data.table is returned.</p>
<p>Also continue reading and see the FAQ after next. Skim whole documents before getting stuck in one part.</p>

<p>The <code>j</code> expression is the 2nd argument. Try <code>DT[ , c(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;,&quot;z&quot;)]</code> or <code>DT[ , .(x,y,z)]</code>.</p>
<h2 id="i-assigned-a-variable-mycol-quot-x-quot-but-then-dt-mycol-returns-an-error-how-do-i-get-it-to-look-up-the-column-name-contained-in-the-mycol-variable"><span class="section-number">1.5</span> I assigned a variable <code>mycol=&quot;x&quot;</code> but then <code>DT[, mycol]</code> returns an error. How do I get it to look up the column name contained in the <code>mycol</code> variable?</h2>
<p>The error is that column named <code>&quot;mycol&quot;</code> cannot be found, and this error is correct. <code>data.table</code>â€™s scoping is different to <code>data.frame</code> in that you can use column names as if they are variables directly inside <code>DT[...]</code> without prefixing each column name with <code>DT$</code>; see FAQ 1.1 above.</p>
<p>To use <code>mycol</code> to select the column <code>x</code> from <code>DT</code>, there are a few options:</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">DT[, ..mycol]            # .. prefix conveys to look for the mycol one level up in calling scope
DT[, mycol, with=FALSE]  # revert to data.frame behavior
DT[[mycol]]               # treat DT as a list and use [[ from base R
</code></pre>
<p>See <code>?data.table</code> for more details about the <code>..</code> prefix.</p>
<p>The <code>with</code> argument takes its name from the <code>base</code> function <code>with()</code>. When <code>with=TRUE</code> (default), <code>data.table</code> operates similar to <code>with()</code>, i.e. <code>DT[, mycol]</code> behaves like <code>with(DT, mycol)</code>. When <code>with=FALSE</code>, the standard <code>data.frame</code> evaluation rules apply to all variables in <code>j</code> and you can no longer use column names directly.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-benefits-of-being-able-to-use-column-names-as-if-they-are-variables-inside-dt"><span class="section-number">1.6</span> What are the benefits of being able to use column names as if they are variables inside <code>DT[...]</code>?</h2>
<p><code>j</code> doesnâ€™t have to be just column names. You can write any R <em>expression</em> of column names directly in <code>j</code>, <em>e.g.</em>, <code>DT[ , mean(x*y/z)]</code>.  The same applies to <code>i</code>, <em>e.g.</em>, <code>DT[x&gt;1000, sum(y*z)]</code>.</p>
<p>This runs the <code>j</code> expression on the set of rows where the <code>i</code> expression is true. You donâ€™t even need to return data, <em>e.g.</em>, <code>DT[x&gt;1000, plot(y, z)]</code>. You can do <code>j</code> by group simply by adding <code>by = </code>; e.g., <code>DT[x&gt;1000, sum(y*z), by = w]</code>. This runs <code>j</code> for each group in column <code>w</code> but just over the rows where <code>x&gt;1000</code>. By placing the 3 parts of the query (i=where, j=select and by=group by) inside the square brackets, data.table sees this query as a whole before any part of it is evaluated. Thus it can optimize the combined query for performance. It can do this because the R language uniquely has lazy evaluation (Python and Julia do not). data.table sees the expressions inside <code>DT[...]</code> before they are evaluated and optimizes them before evaluation. For example, if data.table see that youâ€™re only using 2 columns out of 100, it wonâ€™t bother to subset the 98 that arenâ€™t needed by your j expression.</p>
<h2 id="ok-i-m-starting-to-see-what-data-table-is-about-but-why-didn-t-you-just-enhance-data-frame-in-r-why-does-it-have-to-be-a-new-package"><span class="section-number">1.7</span> OK, Iâ€™m starting to see what data.table is about, but why didnâ€™t you just enhance <code>data.frame</code> in R? Why does it have to be a new package?</h2>
<p>As <a href="#j-num">highlighted above</a>, <code>j</code> in <code>[.data.table</code> is fundamentally different from <code>j</code> in <code>[.data.frame</code>. Even if something as simple as <code>DF[ , 1]</code> was changed in base R to return a data.frame rather than a vector, that would break existing code in many 1000â€™s of CRAN packages and user code. As soon as we took the step to create a new class that inherited from data.frame, we had the opportunity to change a few things and we did. We want data.table to be slightly different and to work this way for more complicated syntax to work. There are other differences, too (see <a href="#SmallerDiffs">below</a> ).</p>
<p>Furthermore, data.table <em>inherits</em> from <code>data.frame</code>. It <em>is</em> a <code>data.frame</code>, too. A data.table can be passed to any package that only accepts <code>data.frame</code> and that package can use <code>[.data.frame</code> syntax on the data.table. See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/10529888/403310">this answer</a> for how that is achieved.</p>
<p>We <em>have</em> proposed enhancements to R wherever possible, too. One of these was accepted as a new feature in R 2.12.0:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>unique()</code> and <code>match()</code> are now faster on character vectors where all elements are in the global CHARSXP cache and have unmarked encoding (ASCII).  Thanks to Matt Dowle for suggesting improvements to the way the hash code is generated in unique.c.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A second proposal was to use <code>memcpy</code> in duplicate.c, which is much faster than a for loop in C. This would improve the <em>way</em> that R copies data internally (on some measures by 13 times). The thread on r-devel is <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2010-April/057249.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>A third more significant proposal that was accepted is that R now uses data.tableâ€™s radix sort code as from R 3.3.0:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The radix sort algorithm and implementation from data.table (forder) replaces the previous radix (counting) sort and adds a new method for order(). Contributed by Matt Dowle and Arun Srinivasan, the new algorithm supports logical, integer (even with large values), real, and character vectors. It outperforms all other methods, but there are some caveats (see ?sort).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was big event for us and we celebrated until the cows came home. (Not really.)</p>
<h2 id="why-are-the-defaults-the-way-they-are-why-does-it-work-the-way-it-does"><span class="section-number">1.8</span> Why are the defaults the way they are? Why does it work the way it does?</h2>
<p>The simple answer is because the main author originally designed it for his own use. He wanted it that way. He finds it a more natural, faster way to write code, which also executes more quickly.</p>
<h2 id="isn-t-this-already-done-by-with-and-subset-in-base"><span class="section-number">1.9</span> Isnâ€™t this already done by <code>with()</code> and <code>subset()</code> in <code>base</code>?</h2>
<p>Some of the features discussed so far are, yes. The package builds upon base functionality. It does the same sorts of things but with less code required and executes many times faster if used correctly.</p>
<h2 id="why-does-x-y-return-all-the-columns-from-y-too-shouldn-t-it-return-a-subset-of-x"><span class="section-number">1.10</span> Why does <code>X[Y]</code> return all the columns from <code>Y</code> too? Shouldnâ€™t it return a subset of <code>X</code>?</h2>
<p>This was changed in v1.5.3 (Feb 2011). Since then <code>X[Y]</code> includes <code>Y</code>â€™s non-join columns. We refer to this feature as <em>join inherited scope</em> because not only are <code>X</code> columns available to the <code>j</code> expression, so are <code>Y</code> columns. The downside is that <code>X[Y]</code> is less efficient since every item of <code>Y</code>â€™s non-join columns are duplicated to match the (likely large) number of rows in <code>X</code> that match. We therefore strongly encourage <code>X[Y, j]</code> instead of <code>X[Y]</code>. See <a href="#MergeDiff">next FAQ</a>.</p>
<h2 id="MergeDiff"><span class="section-number">1.11</span> What is the difference between <code>X[Y]</code> and <code>merge(X, Y)</code>?</h2>
<p><code>X[Y]</code> is a join, looking up <code>X</code>â€™s rows using <code>Y</code> (or <code>Y</code>â€™s key if it has one) as an index.</p>
<p><code>Y[X]</code> is a join, looking up <code>Y</code>â€™s rows using <code>X</code> (or <code>X</code>â€™s key if it has one) as an index.</p>
<p><code>merge(X,Y)</code><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn-1" id="fnref-1" data-footnote-ref>1</a></sup> does both ways at the same time. The number of rows of <code>X[Y]</code> and <code>Y[X]</code> usually differ, whereas the number of rows returned by <code>merge(X, Y)</code> and <code>merge(Y, X)</code> is the same.</p>
<p><em>BUT</em> that misses the main point. Most tasks require something to be done on the data after a join or merge. Why merge all the columns of data, only to use a small subset of them afterwards? You may suggest <code>merge(X[ , ColsNeeded1], Y[ , ColsNeeded2])</code>, but that requires the programmer to work out which columns are needed. <code>X[Y, j]</code> in data.table does all that in one step for you. When you write <code>X[Y, sum(foo*bar)]</code>, data.table automatically inspects the <code>j</code> expression to see which columns it uses.  It will subset those columns only; the others are ignored. Memory is only created for the columns <code>j</code> uses and <code>Y</code> columns enjoy standard R recycling rules within the context of each group. Letâ€™s say <code>foo</code> is in <code>X</code> and <code>bar</code> is in <code>Y</code> (along with 20 other columns in <code>Y</code>). Isnâ€™t <code>X[Y, sum(foo*bar)]</code> quicker to program and quicker to run than a <code>merge</code> of everything wastefully followed by a <code>subset</code>?</p>
<h2 id="anything-else-about-x-y-sum-foo-bar"><span class="section-number">1.12</span> Anything else about <code>X[Y, sum(foo*bar)]</code>?</h2>
<p>This behaviour changed in v1.9.4 (Sep 2014). It now does the <code>X[Y]</code> join and then runs <code>sum(foo*bar)</code> over all the rows; i.e., <code>X[Y][ , sum(foo*bar)]</code>. It used to run <code>j</code> for each <em>group</em> of <code>X</code> that each row of <code>Y</code> matches to. That can still be done as itâ€™s very useful but you now need to be explicit and specify <code>by = .EACHI</code>, <em>i.e.</em>, <code>X[Y, sum(foo*bar), by = .EACHI]</code>. We call this <em>grouping by each <code>i</code></em>.</p>
<p>For example, (further complicating it by using <em>join inherited scope</em>, too):</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">X = data.table(grp = c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;,
                       &quot;b&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;c&quot;), foo = 1:7)
setkey(X, grp)
Y = data.table(c(&quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;), bar = c(4, 2))
X
# Key: &lt;grp&gt;
#       grp   foo
#    &lt;char&gt; &lt;int&gt;
# 1:      a     1
# 2:      a     2
# 3:      b     3
# 4:      b     4
# 5:      b     5
# 6:      c     6
# 7:      c     7
Y
#        V1   bar
#    &lt;char&gt; &lt;num&gt;
# 1:      b     4
# 2:      c     2
X[Y, sum(foo*bar)]
# [1] 74
X[Y, sum(foo*bar), by = .EACHI]
# Key: &lt;grp&gt;
#       grp    V1
#    &lt;char&gt; &lt;num&gt;
# 1:      b    48

<h2 id="that-s-nice-how-did-you-manage-to-change-it-given-that-users-depended-on-the-old-behaviour"><span class="section-number">1.13</span> Thatâ€™s nice. How did you manage to change it given that users depended on the old behaviour?</h2>
<p>The request to change came from users. The feeling was that if a query is doing grouping then an explicit <code>by=</code> should be present for code readability reasons. An option was provided to return the old behaviour: <code>options(datatable.old.bywithoutby)</code>, by default <code>FALSE</code>. This enabled upgrading to test the other new features / bug fixes in v1.9.4, with later migration of any by-without-by queries when ready by adding <code>by=.EACHI</code> to them. We retained 47 pre-change tests and added them back as new tests, tested under <code>options(datatable.old.bywithoutby=TRUE)</code>. We added a startup message about the change and how to revert to the old behaviour. After 1 year the option was deprecated with warning when used. After 2 years the option to revert to old behaviour was removed.</p>
<p>Of the 66 packages on CRAN or Bioconductor that depended on or import data.table at the time of releasing v1.9.4 (it is now over 300), only one was affected by the change. That could be because many packages donâ€™t have comprehensive tests, or just that grouping by each row in <code>i</code> wasnâ€™t being used much by downstream packages. We always test the new version with all dependent packages before release and coordinate any changes with those maintainers. So this release was quite straightforward in that regard.</p>
<p>Another compelling reason to make the change was that previously, there was no efficient way to achieve what <code>X[Y, sum(foo*bar)]</code> does now. You had to write <code>X[Y][ , sum(foo*bar)]</code>. That was suboptimal because <code>X[Y]</code> joined all the columns and passed them all to the second compound query without knowing that only <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code> are needed. To solve that efficiency problem, extra programming effort was required: <code>X[Y, list(foo, bar)][ , sum(foo*bar)]</code>.  The change to <code>by = .EACHI</code> has simplified this by allowing both queries to be expressed inside a single <code>DT[...]</code> query for efficiency.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-avoid-writing-a-really-long-j-expression-you-ve-said-that-i-should-use-the-column-names-but-i-ve-got-a-lot-of-columns"><span class="section-number">2.1</span> How can I avoid writing a really long <code>j</code> expression? Youâ€™ve said that I should use the column <em>names</em>, but Iâ€™ve got a lot of columns.</h2>
<p>When grouping, the <code>j</code> expression can use column names as variables, as you know, but it can also use a reserved symbol <code>.SD</code> which refers to the <strong>S</strong>ubset of the <strong>D</strong>ata.table for each group (excluding the grouping columns). So to sum up all your columns itâ€™s just <code>DT[ , lapply(.SD, sum), by = grp]</code>. It might seem tricky, but itâ€™s fast to write and fast to run. Notice you donâ€™t have to create an anonymous function. The <code>.SD</code> object is efficiently implemented internally and more efficient than passing an argument to a function. But if the <code>.SD</code> symbol appears in <code>j</code> then data.table has to populate <code>.SD</code> fully for each group even if <code>j</code> doesnâ€™t use all of it.</p>
<p>So please donâ€™t do, for example, <code>DT[ , sum(.SD[[&quot;sales&quot;]]), by = grp]</code>. That works but is inefficient and inelegant. <code>DT[ , sum(sales), by = grp]</code> is what was intended, and it could be 100s of times faster. If you use <em>all</em> of the data in <code>.SD</code> for each group (such as in <code>DT[ , lapply(.SD, sum), by = grp]</code>) then thatâ€™s very good usage of <code>.SD</code>. If youâ€™re using <em>several</em> but not <em>all</em> of the columns, you can combine <code>.SD</code> with <code>.SDcols</code>; see <code>?data.table</code>.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-the-default-for-mult-now-quot-all-quot"><span class="section-number">2.2</span> Why is the default for <code>mult</code> now <code>&quot;all&quot;</code>?</h2>
<p>In v1.5.3 the default was changed to <code>&quot;all&quot;</code>. When <code>i</code> (or <code>i</code>â€™s key if it has one) has fewer columns than <code>x</code>â€™s key, <code>mult</code> was already set to <code>&quot;all&quot;</code> automatically. Changing the default makes this clearer and easier for users as it came up quite often.</p>
<p>In versions up to v1.3, <code>&quot;all&quot;</code> was slower. Internally, <code>&quot;all&quot;</code> was implemented by joining using <code>&quot;first&quot;</code>, then again from scratch using <code>&quot;last&quot;</code>, after which a diff between them was performed to work out the span of the matches in <code>x</code> for each row in <code>i</code>. Most often we join to single rows, though, where <code>&quot;first&quot;</code>,<code>&quot;last&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;all&quot;</code> return the same result. We preferred maximum performance for the majority of situations so the default chosen was <code>&quot;first&quot;</code>. When working with a non-unique key (generally a single column containing a grouping variable), <code>DT[&quot;A&quot;]</code> returned the first row of that group so <code>DT[&quot;A&quot;, mult = &quot;all&quot;]</code> was needed to return all the rows in that group.</p>
<p>In v1.4 the binary search in C was changed to branch at the deepest level to find first and last. That branch will likely occur within the same final pages of RAM so there should no longer be a speed disadvantage in defaulting <code>mult</code> to <code>&quot;all&quot;</code>. We warned that the default might change and made the change in v1.5.3.</p>
<p>A future version of data.table may allow a distinction between a key and a <em>unique key</em>. Internally <code>mult = &quot;all&quot;</code> would perform more like <code>mult = &quot;first&quot;</code> when all <code>x</code>â€™s key columns were joined to and <code>x</code>â€™s key was a unique key. data.table would need checks on insert and update to make sure a unique key is maintained. An advantage of specifying a unique key would be that data.table would ensure no duplicates could be inserted, in addition to performance.</p>
<h2 id="i-m-using-c-in-j-and-getting-strange-results"><span class="section-number">2.3</span> Iâ€™m using <code>c()</code> in <code>j</code> and getting strange results.</h2>
<p>This is a common source of confusion. In <code>data.frame</code> you are used to, for example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">DF = data.frame(x = 1:3, y = 4:6, z = 7:9)
DF
#   x y z
# 1 1 4 7
# 2 2 5 8
# 3 3 6 9
DF[ , c(&quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;)]
#   y z
# 1 4 7
# 2 5 8
# 3 6 9
</code></pre>
<p>which returns the two columns. In data.table you know you can use the column names directly and might try:</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">DT = data.table(DF)
DT[ , c(y, z)]
# [1] 4 5 6 7 8 9
</code></pre>
<p>but this returns one vector.  Remember that the <code>j</code> expression is evaluated within the environment of <code>DT</code> and <code>c()</code> returns a vector.  If 2 or more columns are required, use <code>list()</code> or <code>.()</code> instead:</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">DT[ , .(y, z)]
#        y     z
#    &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;
# 1:     4     7
# 2:     5     8
# 3:     6     9
</code></pre>
<p><code>c()</code> can be useful in a data.table too, but its behaviour is different from that in <code>[.data.frame</code>.</p>

I want to use it as a template for a new table; <em>i.e.</em>, create a new table with no rows, but with the column names and types copied from my table. Can I do that easily?</h2>
<p>Yes. If your complex table is called <code>DT</code>, try <code>NEWDT = DT[0]</code>.</p>
<h2 id="is-a-null-data-table-the-same-as-dt-0"><span class="section-number">2.5</span> Is a null data.table the same as <code>DT[0]</code>?</h2>
<p>No. By â€œnull data.tableâ€ we mean the result of <code>data.table(NULL)</code> or <code>as.data.table(NULL)</code>; <em>i.e.</em>,</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">data.table(NULL)
# Null data.table (0 rows and 0 cols)
data.frame(NULL)
# data frame with 0 columns and 0 rows
as.data.table(NULL)
# Null data.table (0 rows and 0 cols)
as.data.frame(NULL)
# data frame with 0 columns and 0 rows
is.null(data.table(NULL))
# [1] FALSE
is.null(data.frame(NULL))
# [1] FALSE
</code></pre>
<p>The null data.table|<code>frame</code> is <code>NULL</code> with some attributes attached, which means itâ€™s no longer <code>NULL</code>. In R only pure <code>NULL</code> is <code>NULL</code> as tested by <code>is.null()</code>. When referring to the â€œnull data.tableâ€ we use lower case null to help distinguish from upper case <code>NULL</code>. To test for the null data.table, use <code>length(DT) == 0</code> or <code>ncol(DT) == 0</code> (<code>length</code> is slightly faster as itâ€™s a primitive function).</p>
<p>An <em>empty</em> data.table (<code>DT[0]</code>) has one or more columns, all of which are empty. Those empty columns still have names and types.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">DT = data.table(a = 1:3, b = c(4, 5, 6), d = c(7L,8L,9L))
DT[0]
# Empty data.table (0 rows and 3 cols): a,b,d
sapply(DT[0], class)
#         a         b         d 
# &quot;integer&quot; &quot;numeric&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
</code></pre>
<h2 id="DTremove1"><span class="section-number">2.6</span> Why has the <code>DT()</code> alias been removed?</h2>
<p><code>DT</code> was introduced originally as a wrapper for a list of <code>j </code>expressions. Since <code>DT</code> was an alias for data.table, this was a convenient way to take care of silent recycling in cases where each item of the <code>j</code> list evaluated to different lengths. The alias was one reason grouping was slow, though.</p>
<p>As of v1.3, <code>list()</code> or <code>.()</code> should be passed instead to the <code>j</code> argument. These are much faster, especially when there are many groups. Internally, this was a non-trivial change. Vector recycling is now done internally, along with several other speed enhancements for grouping.</p>
<h2 id="DTremove2"><span class="section-number">2.7</span> But my code uses <code>j = DT(...)</code> and it works. The previous FAQ says that <code>DT()</code> has been removed.</h2>
<p>Then you are using a version prior to 1.5.3. Prior to 1.5.3 <code>[.data.table</code> detected use of <code>DT()</code> in the <code>j</code> and automatically replaced it with a call to <code>list()</code>. This was to help the transition for existing users.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-scoping-rules-for-j-expressions"><span class="section-number">2.8</span> What are the scoping rules for <code>j</code> expressions?</h2>
<p>Think of the subset as an environment where all the column names are variables. When a variable <code>foo</code> is used in the <code>j</code> of a query such as <code>X[Y, sum(foo)]</code>, <code>foo</code> is looked for in the following order:</p>
<ol>
<li>The scope of <code>X</code>â€™s subset; <em>i.e.</em>, <code>X</code>â€™s column names.</li>
<li>The scope of each row of <code>Y</code>; <em>i.e.</em>, <code>Y</code>â€™s column names (<em>join inherited scope</em>)</li>
<li>The scope of the calling frame; <em>e.g.</em>, the line that appears before the data.table query.</li>
<li>Exercise for reader: does it then ripple up the calling frames, or go straight to <code>globalenv()</code>?</li>
<li>The global environment</li>
</ol>
<p>This is <em>lexical scoping</em> as explained in <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html#Lexical-scoping">R FAQ 3.3.1</a>. The environment in which the function was created is not relevant, though, because there is <em>no function</em>. No anonymous <em>function</em> is passed to <code>j</code>. Instead, an anonymous <em>body</em> is passed to <code>j</code>; for example,</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">DT = data.table(x = rep(c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;), c(2, 3)), y = 1:5)
DT
#         x     y
#    &lt;char&gt; &lt;int&gt;
# 1:      a     1
# 2:      a     2
# 3:      b     3
# 4:      b     4
# 5:      b     5
DT[ , {z = sum(y); z + 3}, by = x]

# 1:      a     6
# 2:      b    15

<p>Some programming languages call this a <em>lambda</em>.</p>
<h2 id="j-trace"><span class="section-number">2.9</span> Can I trace the <code>j</code> expression as it runs through the groups?</h2>

<h2 id="inside-each-group-why-are-the-group-variables-length-1"><span class="section-number">2.10</span> Inside each group, why are the group variables length-1?</h2>
<p><a href="#j-trace">Above</a>, <code>x</code> is a grouping variable and (as from v1.6.1) has <code>length</code> 1 (if inspected or used in <code>j</code>). Itâ€™s for efficiency and convenience. Therefore, there is no difference between the following two statements:</p>

<p>If you need the size of the current group, use <code>.N</code> rather than calling <code>length()</code> on any column.</p>
<h2 id="only-the-first-10-rows-are-printed-how-do-i-print-more"><span class="section-number">2.11</span> Only the first 10 rows are printed, how do I print more?</h2>
<p>There are two things happening here. First, if the number of rows in a data.table are large (<code>&gt; 100</code> by default), then a summary of the data.table is printed to the console by default. Second, the summary of a large data.table is printed by taking the top and bottom <code>n</code> (<code>= 5</code> by default) rows of the data.table and only printing those. Both of these parameters (when to trigger a summary and how much of a table to use as a summary) are configurable by Râ€™s <code>options</code> mechanism, or by calling the <code>print</code> function directly.</p>
<p>For instance, to enforce the summary of a data.table to only happen when a data.table is greater than 50 rows, you could <code>options(datatable.print.nrows = 50)</code>. To disable the summary-by-default completely, you could <code>options(datatable.print.nrows = Inf)</code>. You could also call <code>print</code> directly, as in <code>print(your.data.table, nrows = Inf)</code>.</p>
<p>If you want to show more than just the top (and bottom) 10 rows of a data.table summary (say you like 20), set <code>options(datatable.print.topn = 20)</code>, for example. Again, you could also just call <code>print</code> directly, as in <code>print(your.data.table, topn = 20)</code>.</p>

<p>When <code>i</code> is a single name such as <code>Y</code> it is evaluated in the calling frame. In all other cases such as calls to <code>.()</code> or other expressions, <code>i</code> is evaluated within the scope of <code>X</code>. This facilitates easy <em>self-joins</em> such as <code>X[J(unique(colA)), mult = &quot;first&quot;]</code>.</p>

Iâ€™d like it to use the table <code>Y</code> in calling scope.</h2>
<p>The <code>Z[Y]</code> part is not a single name so that is evaluated within the frame of <code>X</code> and the problem occurs. Try <code>tmp = Z[Y]; X[tmp]</code>. This is robust to <code>X</code> containing a column <code>&quot;tmp&quot;</code> because <code>tmp</code> is a single name. If you often encounter conflicts of this type, one simple solution may be to name all tables in uppercase and all column names in lowercase, or some similar scheme.</p>

<p>Consider <code>A[B]</code> syntax using an example matrix <code>A</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">A = matrix(1:12, nrow = 4)
A
#      [,1] [,2] [,3]

# [3,]    3    7   11
# [4,]    4    8   12
</code></pre>
<p>To obtain cells <code>(1, 2) = 5</code> and <code>(3, 3) = 11</code> many users (we believe) may try this first:</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">A[c(1, 3), c(2, 3)]
#      [,1] [,2]
# [1,]    5    9
# [2,]    7   11

<p>However, this returns the union of those rows and columns. To reference the cells, a 2-column matrix is required. <code>?Extract</code> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When indexing arrays by <code>[</code> a single argument <code>i</code> can be a matrix with as many columns as there are dimensions of <code>x</code>; the result is then a vector with elements corresponding to the sets of indices in each row of <code>i</code>.</p>

<p>A matrix is a 2-dimensional structure with row names and column names. Can we do the same with names?</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">rownames(A) = letters[1:4]

<p>So yes, we can. Can we do the same with a <code>data.frame</code>?</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">A = data.frame(A = 1:4, B = letters[11:14], C = pi*1:4)

<p>But, notice that the result was coerced to <code>character.</code> R coerced <code>A</code> to <code>matrix</code> first so that the syntax could work, but the result isnâ€™t ideal.  Letâ€™s try making <code>B</code> a <code>data.frame</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">B = data.frame(c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;c&quot;), c(&quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;))
cat(try(A[B], silent = TRUE))
# Error in `[.default`(A, B) : invalid subscript type 'list'
</code></pre>
<p>So we canâ€™t subset a <code>data.frame</code> by a <code>data.frame</code> in base R. What if we want row names and column names that arenâ€™t <code>character</code> but <code>integer</code> or <code>float</code>? What if we want more than 2 dimensions of mixed types? Enter data.table.</p>
<p>Furthermore, matrices, especially sparse matrices, are often stored in a 3-column tuple: <code>(i, j, value)</code>. This can be thought of as a key-value pair where <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> form a 2-column key. If we have more than one value, perhaps of different types, it might look like <code>(i, j, val1, val2, val3, ...)</code>. This looks very much like a <code>data.frame</code>. Hence data.table extends <code>data.frame</code> so that a <code>data.frame</code> <code>X</code> can be subset by a <code>data.frame</code> <code>Y</code>, leading to the <code>X[Y]</code> syntax.</p>
<h2 id="can-base-be-changed-to-do-this-then-rather-than-a-new-package"><span class="section-number">2.15</span> Can base be changed to do this then, rather than a new package?</h2>
<p><code>data.frame</code> is used <em>everywhere</em> and so it is very difficult to make <em>any</em> changes to it.
data.table <em>inherits</em> from <code>data.frame</code>. It <em>is</em> a <code>data.frame</code>, too. A data.table <em>can</em> be passed to any package that <em>only</em> accepts <code>data.frame</code>. When that package uses <code>[.data.frame</code> syntax on the data.table, it works. It works because <code>[.data.table</code> looks to see where it was called from. If it was called from such a package, <code>[.data.table</code> diverts to <code>[.data.frame</code>.</p>
<h2 id="i-ve-heard-that-data-table-syntax-is-analogous-to-sql"><span class="section-number">2.16</span> Iâ€™ve heard that data.table syntax is analogous to SQL.</h2>
<p>Yes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>i</code>  \(\Leftrightarrow\) where</li>
<li><code>j</code>  \(\Leftrightarrow\)  select</li>
<li><code>:=</code>  \(\Leftrightarrow\)  update</li>
<li><code>by</code>  \(\Leftrightarrow\)  group by</li>
<li><code>i</code>  \(\Leftrightarrow\)  order by (in compound syntax)</li>
<li><code>i</code>  \(\Leftrightarrow\)  having (in compound syntax)</li>
<li><code>nomatch = NA</code>  \(\Leftrightarrow\)  outer join</li>
<li><code>nomatch = NULL</code>  \(\Leftrightarrow\)  inner join</li>
<li><code>mult = &quot;first&quot;|&quot;last&quot;</code>  \(\Leftrightarrow\)  N/A because SQL is inherently unordered</li>
<li><code>roll = TRUE</code>  \(\Leftrightarrow\)  N/A because SQL is inherently unordered</li>
</ul>
<p>The general form is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">DT[where, select|update, group by][order by][...] ... [...]
</code></pre>
<p>A key advantage of column vectors in R is that they are <em>ordered</em>, unlike SQL<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn-2" id="fnref-2" data-footnote-ref>2</a></sup>. We can use ordered functions in <code>data.table</code> queries such as <code>diff()</code> and we can use <em>any</em> R function from any package, not just the functions that are defined in SQL. A disadvantage is that R objects must fit in memory, but with several R packages such as <code>ff</code>, <code>bigmemory</code>, <code>mmap</code> and <code>indexing</code>, this is changing.</p>
<h2 id="SmallerDiffs"><span class="section-number">2.17</span> What are the smaller syntax differences between <code>data.frame</code> and data.table</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>DT[3]</code> refers to the 3rd <em>row</em>, but <code>DF[3]</code> refers to the 3rd <em>column</em></li>
<li><code>DT[3, ] == DT[3]</code>, but <code>DF[ , 3] == DF[3]</code> (somewhat confusingly in data.frame, whereas data.table is consistent)</li>
<li>For this reason we say the comma is <em>optional</em> in <code>DT</code>, but not optional in <code>DF</code></li>
<li><code>DT[[3]] == DF[, 3] == DF[[3]]</code></li>
<li><code>DT[i, ]</code>, where <code>i</code> is a single integer, returns a single row, just like <code>DF[i, ]</code>, but unlike a matrix single-row subset which returns a vector.</li>
<li><code>DT[ , j]</code> where <code>j</code> is a single integer returns a one-column data.table, unlike <code>DF[, j]</code> which returns a vector by default</li>
<li><code>DT[ , &quot;colA&quot;][[1]] == DF[ , &quot;colA&quot;]</code>.</li>
<li><code>DT[ , colA] == DF[ , &quot;colA&quot;]</code> (currently in data.table v1.9.8 but is about to change, see release notes)</li>
<li><code>DT[ , list(colA)] == DF[ , &quot;colA&quot;, drop = FALSE]</code></li>
<li><code>DT[NA]</code> returns 1 row of <code>NA</code>, but <code>DF[NA]</code> returns an entire copy of <code>DF</code> containing <code>NA</code> throughout. The symbol <code>NA</code> is type <code>logical</code> in R and is therefore recycled by <code>[.data.frame</code>. The userâ€™s intention was probably <code>DF[NA_integer_]</code>. <code>[.data.table</code> diverts to this probable intention automatically, for convenience.</li>
<li><code>DT[c(TRUE, NA, FALSE)]</code> treats the <code>NA</code> as <code>FALSE</code>, but <code>DF[c(TRUE, NA, FALSE)]</code> returns
<code>NA</code> rows for each <code>NA</code></li>
<li><code>DT[ColA == ColB]</code> is simpler than <code>DF[!is.na(ColA) &amp; !is.na(ColB) &amp; ColA == ColB, ]</code></li>
<li><code>data.frame(list(1:2, &quot;k&quot;, 1:4))</code> creates 3 columns, data.table creates one <code>list</code> column.</li>
<li><code>check.names</code> is by default <code>TRUE</code> in <code>data.frame</code> but <code>FALSE</code> in data.table, for convenience.</li>
<li><code>data.table</code> has always set <code>stringsAsFactors=FALSE</code> by default. In R 4.0.0 (Apr 2020), <code>data.frame</code>â€™s default was changed from <code>TRUE</code> to <code>FALSE</code> and there is no longer a difference in this regard; see <a href="https://developer.r-project.org/Blog/public/2020/02/16/stringsasfactors/">stringsAsFactors, Kurt Hornik, Feb 2020</a>.</li>
<li>Atomic vectors in <code>list</code> columns are collapsed when printed using <code>&quot;, &quot;</code> in <code>data.frame</code>, but <code>&quot;,&quot;</code> in data.table with a trailing comma after the 6th item to avoid accidental printing of large embedded objects.</li>
<li>Unlike data.frames a data.table cannot store rows with no columns, as rows are considered to be the children of columns: <code>nrow(DF[, 0])</code> returns the number of rows, while <code>nrow(DT[, 0])</code> always returns 0; but see issue <a href="https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/2422">#2422</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In <code>[.data.frame</code> we very often set <code>drop = FALSE</code>. When we forget, bugs can arise in edge cases where single columns are selected and all of a sudden a vector is returned rather than a single column <code>data.frame</code>. In <code>[.data.table</code> we took the opportunity to make it consistent and dropped <code>drop</code>.</p>
<p>When a data.table is passed to a data.table-unaware package, that package is not concerned with any of these differences; it just works.</p>

<p>In this case <code>j</code> can be wrapped with <code>invisible()</code>; e.g., <code>DT[ , invisible(hist(colB)), by = colA]</code><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn-3" id="fnref-3" data-footnote-ref>3</a></sup></p>

<p>So that data.table can inherit from <code>data.frame</code> without using <code>...</code>. If we used <code>...</code> then invalid argument names would not be caught.</p>
<p>The <code>drop</code> argument is never used by <code>[.data.table</code>. It is a placeholder for non-data.table-aware packages when they use the <code>[.data.frame</code> syntax directly on a data.table.</p>

<p>This has changed in v1.8.3 to meet your expectations. Please upgrade.</p>
<p>The whole of <code>DT</code> is returned (now invisibly) so that compound syntax can work; <em>e.g.</em>, <code>DT[i, done := TRUE][ , sum(done)]</code>.

<p>R internally forces visibility on for <code>[</code>. The value of FunTabâ€™s eval column (see <a href="https://github.com/wch/r-source/blob/trunk/src/main/names.c">src/main/names.c</a>) for <code>[</code> is <code>0</code> meaning â€œforce <code>R_Visible</code> onâ€ (see <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-ints.html#Autoprinting">R-Internals section 1.6</a> ). Therefore, when we tried <code>invisible()</code> or setting <code>R_Visible</code> to <code>0</code> directly ourselves, <code>eval</code> in <a href="https://github.com/wch/r-source/blob/trunk/src/main/eval.c">src/main/eval.c</a> would force it on again.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, the key was to stop trying to stop the print method running after a <code>:=</code>. Instead, inside <code>:=</code> we now (from v1.8.3) set a global flag which the print method uses to know whether to actually print or not.</p>
<h2 id="why-do-i-have-to-type-dt-sometimes-twice-after-using-to-print-the-result-to-console"><span class="section-number">2.23</span> Why do I have to type <code>DT</code> sometimes twice after using <code>:=</code> to print the result to console?</h2>
<p>This is an unfortunate downside to get <a href="https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/869">#869</a> to work. If a <code>:=</code> is used inside a function with no <code>DT[]</code> before the end of the function, then the next time <code>DT</code> is typed at the prompt, nothing will be printed. A repeated <code>DT</code> will print. To avoid this: include a <code>DT[]</code> after the last <code>:=</code> in your function. If that is not possible (e.g., itâ€™s not a function you can change) then <code>print(DT)</code> and <code>DT[]</code> at the prompt are guaranteed to print. As before, adding an extra <code>[]</code> on the end of <code>:=</code> query is a recommended idiom to update and then print; e.g.&gt; <code>DT[,foo:=3L][]</code>.</p>

How is this possible? Why?</h2>
<p>It was a temporary, last resort solution before rbind and cbind S3 method dispatch was fixed in R &gt;= 4.0.0. Essentially, the issue was that <code>data.table</code> inherits from <code>data.frame</code>, <em>and</em> <code>base::cbind</code> and <code>base::rbind</code> (uniquely) do their own S3 dispatch internally as documented by <code>?cbind</code>. The <code>data.table</code> workaround was adding one <code>for</code> loop to the start of each function directly in <code>base</code>. That modification was made dynamically, <em>i.e.</em>, the <code>base</code> definition of <code>cbind.data.frame</code> was fetched, the <code>for</code> loop added to the beginning, and then assigned back to <code>base</code>. This solution was designed to be robust to different definitions of <code>base::cbind.data.frame</code> in different versions of R, including unknown future changes. It worked well. The competing requirements were:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>cbind(DT, DF)</code> needs to work. Defining <code>cbind.data.table</code> didnâ€™t work because <code>base::cbind</code> does its own S3 dispatch and required (before R 4.0.0) that the <em>first</em> <code>cbind</code> method for each object it is passed is <em>identical</em>. This is not true in <code>cbind(DT, DF)</code> because the first method for <code>DT</code> is <code>cbind.data.table</code> but the first method for <code>DF</code> is <code>cbind.data.frame</code>. <code>base::cbind</code> then fell through to its internal <code>bind</code> code which appears to treat <code>DT</code> as a regular <code>list</code> and returns very odd looking and unusable <code>matrix</code> output. See <a href="#cbinderror">below</a>. We cannot just advise users not to call <code>cbind(DT, DF)</code> because packages such as <code>ggplot2</code> make such a call (<a href="https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/blob/master/inst/tests/tests.Rraw#L444-L447">test 167.2</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This naturally led to trying to mask <code>cbind.data.frame</code> instead. Since a data.table is a <code>data.frame</code>, <code>cbind</code> would find the same method for both <code>DT</code> and <code>DF</code>. However, this didnâ€™t work either because <code>base::cbind</code> appears to find methods in <code>base</code> first; <em>i.e.</em>, <code>base::cbind.data.frame</code> isnâ€™t maskable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, we tried masking <code>cbind</code> itself (v1.6.5 and v1.6.6). This allowed <code>cbind(DT, DF)</code> to work, but introduced compatibility issues with package <code>IRanges</code>, since <code>IRanges</code> also masks <code>cbind</code>. It worked if <code>IRanges</code> was lower on the <code>search()</code> path than data.table, but if <code>IRanges</code> was higher then data.tableâ€™s, <code>cbind</code> would never be called and the strange-looking <code>matrix</code> output occurs again (see <a href="#cbinderror">below</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Many thanks to the R core team for fixing the issue in Sep 2019. data.table v1.12.6+ no longer applies the workaround in R &gt;= 4.0.0.</p>
<h2 id="r-dispatch"><span class="section-number">2.25</span> Iâ€™ve read about method dispatch (<em>e.g.</em> <code>merge</code> may or may not dispatch to <code>merge.data.table</code>) but <em>how</em> does R know how to dispatch? Are dots significant or special? How on earth does R know which function to dispatch and when?</h2>
<p>This comes up quite a lot but itâ€™s really earth-shatteringly simple. A function such as <code>merge</code> is <em>generic</em> if it consists of a call to <code>UseMethod</code>. When you see people talking about whether or not functions are <em>generic</em> functions they are merely typing the function without <code>()</code> afterwards, looking at the program code inside it and if they see a call to <code>UseMethod</code> then it is <em>generic</em>.  What does <code>UseMethod</code> do? It literally slaps the function name together with the class of the first argument, separated by period (<code>.</code>) and then calls that function, passing along the same arguments. Itâ€™s that simple. For example, <code>merge(X, Y)</code> contains a <code>UseMethod</code> call which means it then <em>dispatches</em> (i.e. calls) <code>paste(&quot;merge&quot;, class(X), sep = &quot;.&quot;)</code>. Functions with dots in their name may or may not be methods. The dot is irrelevant really, other than dot being the separator that <code>UseMethod</code> uses. Knowing this background should now highlight why, for example, it is obvious to R folk that <code>as.data.table.data.frame</code>  is the <code>data.frame</code> method for the <code>as.data.table</code> generic function. Further, it may help to elucidate that, yes, you are correct, it is not obvious from its name alone that <code>ls.fit</code> is not the fit method of the <code>ls</code> generic function. You only know that by typing <code>ls</code> (not <code>ls()</code>) and observing it isnâ€™t a single call to <code>UseMethod</code>.</p>
<p>You might now ask: where is this documented in R? Answer: itâ€™s quite clear, but, you need to first know to look in <code>?UseMethod</code> and <em>that</em> help file contains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When a function calling <code>UseMethod('fun')</code> is applied to an object with class attribute <code>c('first', 'second')</code>, the system searches for a function called <code>fun.first</code> and, if it finds it, applies it to the object. If no such function is found a function called <code>fun.second</code> is tried. If no class name produces a suitable function, the function <code>fun.default</code> is used, if it exists, or an error results.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Happily, an internet search for â€œHow does R method dispatch workâ€ (at the time of this writing) returns the <code>?UseMethod</code> help page in the top few links. Admittedly, other links rapidly descend into the intricacies of S3 vs S4, internal generics and so on.</p>
<p>However, features like basic S3 dispatch (pasting the function name together with the class name) is why some R folk love R. Itâ€™s so simple. No complicated registration or signature is required. There isnâ€™t much needed to learn. To create the <code>merge</code> method for data.table all that was required, literally, was to merely create a function called <code>merge.data.table</code>.</p>

<p>Several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only that column is grouped, the other 19 are ignored because data.table inspects the <code>j</code> expression and realises it doesnâ€™t use the other columns.</li>
<li>One memory allocation is made for the largest group only, then that memory is re-used for the other groups. There is very little garbage to collect.</li>
<li>R is an in-memory column store; i.e., the columns are contiguous in RAM. Page fetches from RAM into L2 cache are minimised.</li>
</ul>

<p>data.table uses radix sorting. This is significantly faster than other sort algorithms. See <a href="https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/wiki/Presentations">our presentations</a> for more information, in particular from useR!2015 Denmark.</p>
<p>This is also one reason why <code>setkey()</code> is quick.</p>
<p>When no <code>key</code> is set, or we group in a different order from that of the key, we call it an <em>ad hoc</em> <code>by</code>.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-grouping-by-columns-in-the-key-faster-than-an-ad-hoc-by"><span class="section-number">3.3</span> Why is grouping by columns in the key faster than an <em>ad hoc</em> <code>by</code>?</h2>
<p>Because each group is contiguous in RAM, thereby minimising page fetches and memory can be
copied in bulk (<code>memcpy</code> in C) rather than looping in C.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-primary-and-secondary-indexes-in-data-table"><span class="section-number">3.4</span> What are primary and secondary indexes in data.table?</h2>
<p>Manual: <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/data.table/functions/setkey"><code>?setkey</code></a>
S.O.: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20039335/what-is-the-purpose-of-setting-a-key-in-data-table/20057411#20057411">What is the purpose of setting a key in data.table?</a></p>
<p><code>setkey(DT, col1, col2)</code> orders the rows by column <code>col1</code> then within each group of <code>col1</code> it orders by <code>col2</code>. This is a <em>primary index</em>. The row order is changed <em>by reference</em> in RAM. Subsequent joins and groups on those key columns then take advantage of the sort order for efficiency. (Imagine how difficult looking for a phone number in a printed telephone directory would be if it wasnâ€™t sorted by surname then forename. Thatâ€™s literally all <code>setkey</code> does. It sorts the rows by the columns you specify.) The index doesnâ€™t use any RAM. It simply changes the row order in RAM and marks the key columns. Analogous to a <em>clustered index</em> in SQL.</p>
<p>However, you can only have one primary key because data can only be physically sorted in RAM in one way at a time. Choose the primary index to be the one you use most often (e.g. <code>[id,date]</code>). Sometimes there isnâ€™t an obvious choice for the primary key or you need to join and group many different columns in different orders. Enter a secondary index. This does use memory (<code>4*nrow</code> bytes regardless of the number of columns in the index) to store the order of the rows by the columns you specify, but doesnâ€™t actually reorder the rows in RAM. Subsequent joins and groups take advantage of the secondary keyâ€™s order but need to <em>hop</em> via that index so arenâ€™t as efficient as primary indexes. But still, a lot faster than a full vector scan. There is no limit to the number of secondary indexes since each one is just a different ordering vector. Typically you donâ€™t need to create secondary indexes. They are created automatically and used for you automatically by using data.table normally; <em>e.g.</em> <code>DT[someCol == someVal, ]</code> and <code>DT[someCol %in% someVals, ]</code> will create, attach and then use the secondary index. This is faster in data.table than a vector scan so automatic indexing is on by default since there is no up-front penalty. There is an option to turn off automatic indexing; <em>e.g.</em>, if somehow many indexes are being created and even the relatively small amount of extra memory becomes too large.</p>
<p>We use the words <em>index</em> and <em>key</em> interchangeably.</p>

<p><code>*.RDS</code> and <code>*.RData</code> are file types which can store in-memory R objects on disk efficiently. However, storing data.table into the binary file loses its column over-allocation. This isnâ€™t a big deal â€“ your data.table will be copied in memory on the next <em>by reference</em> operation and throw a warning. Therefore it is recommended to call <code>setalloccol()</code> on each data.table loaded with <code>readRDS()</code> or <code>load()</code> calls.</p>

This document is focused on using `data.table` as a dependency in other R packages. If you are interested in using `data.table` C code from a non-R application, or in calling its C functions directly, jump to the [last section](#non-r-API) of this vignette.

Importing `data.table` is no different from importing other R packages. This vignette is meant to answer the most common questions arising around that subject; the lessons presented here can be applied to other R packages.

## Why to import `data.table`

One of the biggest features of `data.table` is its concise syntax which makes exploratory analysis faster and easier to write and perceive; this convenience can drive package authors to use `data.table`. Another, perhaps more important reason is high performance. When outsourcing heavy computing tasks from your package to `data.table`, you usually get top performance without needing to re-invent any of these numerical optimization tricks on your own.

## Importing `data.table` is easy

It is very easy to use `data.table` as a dependency due to the fact that `data.table` does not have any of its own dependencies. This applies both to operating system and to R dependencies. It means that if you have R installed on your machine, it already has everything needed to install `data.table`.  It also means that adding `data.table` as a dependency of your package will not result in a chain of other recursive dependencies to install, making it very convenient for offline installation.

## `DESCRIPTION` file {DESCRIPTION}

The first place to define a dependency in a package is the `DESCRIPTION` file. Most commonly, you will need to add `data.table` under the `Imports:` field. Doing so will necessitate an installation of `data.table` before your package can compile/install. As mentioned above, no other packages will be installed because `data.table` does not have any dependencies of its own. You can also specify the minimal required version of a dependency; for example, if your package is using the `fwrite` function, which was introduced in `data.table` in version 1.9.8, you should incorporate this as `Imports: data.table (>= 1.9.8)`. This way you can ensure that the version of `data.table` installed is 1.9.8 or later before your users will be able to install your package. Besides the `Imports:` field, you can also use `Depends: data.table` but we strongly discourage this approach (and may disallow it in future) because this loads `data.table` into your user's workspace; i.e. it enables `data.table` functionality in your user's scripts without them requesting that. `Imports:` is the proper way to use `data.table` within your package without inflicting `data.table` on your user. In fact, we hope the `Depends:` field is eventually deprecated in R since this is true for all packages.

## `NAMESPACE` file {NAMESPACE}

The next thing is to define what content of `data.table` your package is using. This needs to be done in the `NAMESPACE` file. Most commonly, package authors will want to use `import(data.table)` which will import all exported (i.e., listed in `data.table`'s own `NAMESPACE` file) functions from `data.table`.

You may also want to use just a subset of `data.table` functions; for example, some packages may simply make use of `data.table`'s high-performance CSV reader and writer, for which you can add `importFrom(data.table, fread, fwrite)` in your `NAMESPACE` file. It is also possible to import all functions from a package _excluding_ particular ones using `import(data.table, except=c(fread, fwrite))`.

Be sure to read also the note about non-standard evaluation in `data.table` in [the section on "undefined globals"](#globals)

## Usage

As an example we will define two functions in `a.pkg` package that uses `data.table`. One function, `gen`, will generate a simple `data.table`; another, `aggr`, will do a simple aggregation of it.

```r
gen = function (n = 100L) {
  dt = as.data.table(list(id = seq_len(n)))
  dt[, grp := ((id - 1) %% 26) + 1
     ][, grp := letters[grp]
       ][]
}
aggr = function (x) {
  stopifnot(
    is.data.table(x),
    "grp" %in% names(x)
  )
  x[, .N, by = grp]
}
```

## Testing

Be sure to include tests in your package. Before each major release of `data.table`, we check reverse dependencies. This means that if any changes in `data.table` would break your code, we will be able to spot breaking changes and inform you before releasing the new version. This of course assumes you will publish your package to CRAN or Bioconductor. The most basic test can be a plaintext R script in your package directory `tests/test.R`:

```r
library(a.pkg)
dt = gen()
stopifnot(nrow(dt) == 100)
dt2 = aggr(dt)
stopifnot(nrow(dt2) < 100)
```

When testing your package, you may want to use `R CMD check --no-stop-on-test-error`, which will continue after an error and run all your tests (as opposed to stopping on the first line of script that failed) NB this requires R 3.4.0 or greater.

## Testing using `testthat`

It is very common to use the `testthat` package for purpose of tests. Testing a package that imports `data.table` is no different from testing other packages. An example test script `tests/testthat/test-pkg.R`:

```r
context("pkg tests")

test_that("generate dt", { expect_true(nrow(gen()) == 100) })
test_that("aggregate dt", { expect_true(nrow(aggr(gen())) < 100) })
```

If `data.table` is in Suggests (but not Imports) then you need to declare `.datatable.aware=TRUE` in one of the R/* files to avoid "object not found" errors when testing via `testthat::test_package` or `testthat::test_check`.

## Dealing with "undefined global functions or variables" {#globals}

`data.table`'s use of R's deferred evaluation (especially on the left-hand side of `:=`) is not well-recognised by `R CMD check`. This results in `NOTE`s like the following during package check:

```
* checking R code for possible problems ... NOTE
aggr: no visible binding for global variable 'grp'
gen: no visible binding for global variable 'grp'
gen: no visible binding for global variable 'id'
Undefined global functions or variables:
grp id
```

The easiest way to deal with this is to pre-define those variables within your package and set them to `NULL`, optionally adding a comment (as is done in the refined version of `gen` below). When possible, you could also use a character vector instead of symbols (as in `aggr` below):

```r
gen = function (n = 100L) {
  id = grp = NULL # due to NSE notes in R CMD check
  dt = as.data.table(list(id = seq_len(n)))
  dt[, grp := ((id - 1) %% 26) + 1
     ][, grp := letters[grp]
       ][]
}
aggr = function (x) {
  stopifnot(
    is.data.table(x),
    "grp" %in% names(x)
  )
  x[, .N, by = "grp"]
}
```

The case for `data.table`'s special symbols (e.g. `.SD` and `.N`) and assignment operator (`:=`) is slightly different (see `?.N` for more, including a complete listing of such symbols). You should import whichever of these values you use from `data.table`'s namespace to protect against any issues arising from the unlikely scenario that we change the exported value of these in the future, e.g. if you want to use `.N`, `.I`, and `:=`, a minimal `NAMESPACE` would have:

```r
importFrom(data.table, .N, .I, ':=')
```

Much simpler is to just use `import(data.table)` which will greedily allow usage in your package's code of any object exported from `data.table`.

If you don't mind having `id` and `grp` registered as variables globally in your package namespace you can use `?globalVariables`. Be aware that these notes do not have any impact on the code or its functionality; if you are not going to publish your package, you may simply choose to ignore them.

## Care needed when providing and using options

Common practice by R packages is to provide customization options set by `options(name=val)` and fetched using `getOption("name", default)`. Function arguments often specify a call to `getOption()` so that the user knows (from `?fun` or `args(fun)`) the name of the option controlling the default for that parameter; e.g. `fun(..., verbose=getOption("datatable.verbose", FALSE))`. All `data.table` options start with `datatable.` so as to not conflict with options in other packages. A user simply calls `options(datatable.verbose=TRUE)` to turn on verbosity. This affects all data.table function calls unless `verbose=FALSE` is provided explicitly; e.g. `fun(..., verbose=FALSE)`.

The option mechanism in R is _global_. Meaning that if a user sets a `data.table` option for their own use, that setting also affects code inside any package that is using `data.table` too. For an option like `datatable.verbose`, this is exactly the desired behavior since the desire is to trace and log all `data.table` operations from wherever they originate; turning on verbosity does not affect the results. Another unique-to-R and excellent-for-production option is R's `options(warn=2)` which turns all warnings into errors. Again, the desire is to affect any warning in any package so as to not miss any warnings in production. There are 6 `datatable.print.*` options and 3 optimization options which do not affect the result of operations. However, there is one `data.table` option that does and is now a concern: `datatable.nomatch`. This option changes the default join from outer to inner. [Aside, the default join is outer because outer is safer; it doesn't drop missing data silently; moreover it is consistent to base R way of matching by names and indices.] Some users prefer inner join to be the default and we provided this option for them. However, a user setting this option can unintentionally change the behavior of joins inside packages that use `data.table`. Accordingly, in v1.12.4 (Oct 2019) a message was printed when the `datatable.nomatch` option was used, and from v1.14.2 it is now ignored with warning. It was the only `data.table` option with this concern.

## Troubleshooting

If you face any problems in creating a package that uses data.table, please confirm that the problem is reproducible in a clean R session using the R console: `R CMD check package.name`.

Some of the most common issues developers are facing are usually related to helper tools that are meant to automate some package development tasks, for example, using `roxygen` to generate your `NAMESPACE` file from metadata in the R code files. Others are related to helpers that build and check the package. Unfortunately, these helpers sometimes have unintended/hidden side effects which can obscure the source of your troubles. As such, be sure to double check using R console (run R on the command line) and ensure the import is defined in the `DESCRIPTION` and `NAMESPACE` files following the [instructions](#DESCRIPTION) [above](#NAMESPACE).

If you are not able to reproduce problems you have using the plain R console build and check, you may try to get some support based on past issues we've encountered with `data.table` interacting with helper tools: [devtools#192](https://github.com/r-lib/devtools/issues/192) or [devtools#1472](https://github.com/r-lib/devtools/issues/1472).

## License

Since version 1.10.5 `data.table` is licensed as Mozilla Public License (MPL). The reasons for the change from GPL should be read in full [here](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/pull/2456) and you can read more about MPL on Wikipedia [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Public_License) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_free_and_open-source_software_licenses).

## Optionally import `data.table`: Suggests

If you want to use `data.table` conditionally, i.e., only when it is installed, you should use `Suggests: data.table` in your `DESCRIPTION` file instead of using `Imports: data.table`. By default this definition will not force installation of `data.table` when installing your package. This also requires you to conditionally use `data.table` in your package code which should be done using the `?requireNamespace` function. The below example demonstrates conditional use of `data.table`'s fast CSV writer `?fwrite`. If the `data.table` package is not installed, the much-slower base R `?write.table` function is used instead.

```r
my.write = function (x) {
  if(requireNamespace("data.table", quietly=TRUE)) {
    data.table::fwrite(x, "data.csv")
  } else {
    write.table(x, "data.csv")
  }
}
```

A slightly more extended version of this would also ensure that the installed version of `data.table` is recent enough to have the `fwrite` function available:

```r
my.write = function (x) {
  if(requireNamespace("data.table", quietly=TRUE) &&
    utils::packageVersion("data.table") >= "1.9.8") {
    data.table::fwrite(x, "data.csv")
  } else {
    write.table(x, "data.csv")
  }
}
```

When using a package as a suggested dependency, you should not `import` it in the `NAMESPACE` file. Just mention it in the `DESCRIPTION` file.
When using `data.table` functions in package code (R/* files) you need to use the `data.table::` prefix because none of them are imported.
When using `data.table` in package tests (e.g. tests/testthat/test* files), you need to declare `.datatable.aware=TRUE` in one of the R/* files.

## `data.table` in `Imports` but nothing imported

Some users ([e.g.](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/2341)) may prefer to eschew using `importFrom` or `import` in their `NAMESPACE` file and instead use `data.table::` qualification on all internal code (of course keeping `data.table` under their `Imports:` in `DESCRIPTION`).

In this case, the un-exported function `[.data.table` will revert to calling `[.data.frame` as a safeguard since `data.table` has no way of knowing that the parent package is aware it's attempting to make calls against the syntax of `data.table`'s query API (which could lead to unexpected behavior as the structure of calls to `[.data.frame` and `[.data.table` fundamentally differ, e.g. the latter has many more arguments).

If this is anyway your preferred approach to package development, please define `.datatable.aware = TRUE` anywhere in your R source code (no need to export). This tells `data.table` that you as a package developer have designed your code to intentionally rely on `data.table` functionality even though it may not be obvious from inspecting your `NAMESPACE` file.

`data.table` determines on the fly whether the calling function is aware it's tapping into `data.table` with the internal `cedta` function (**C**alling **E**nvironment is **D**ata **T**able **A**ware), which, beyond checking the `?getNamespaceImports` for your package, also checks the existence of this variable (among other things).

## Further information on dependencies

For more canonical documentation of defining packages dependency check the official manual: [Writing R Extensions](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html).

## Importing data.table C routines

Some of internally used C routines are now exported on C level thus can be used in R packages directly from their C code. See [`?cdt`](https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/reference/cdt.html) for details and [Writing R Extensions](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html) _Linking to native routines in other packages_ section for usage.

## Importing from non-r Applications {non-r-api}

Some tiny parts of `data.table` C code were isolated from the R C API and can now be used from non-R applications by linking to .so / .dll files. More concrete details about this will be provided later; for now you can study the C code that was isolated from the R C API in [src/fread.c](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/blob/master/src/fread.c) and [src/fwrite.c](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/blob/master/src/fwrite.c).

## How to convert your Depends dependency on data.table to Imports

To convert a `Depends` dependency on `data.table` to an `Imports` dependency in your package, follow these steps:

### Step 0. Ensure your package is passing R CMD check initially

### Step 1. Update the DESCRIPTION file to put data.table in Imports, not Depends

**Before:**
```dcf
Depends:
    R (>= 3.5.0),
    data.table
Imports:
```

**After:**
```dcf
Depends:
    R (>= 3.5.0)
Imports:
    data.table
```

### Step 2.1: Run `R CMD check`

Run `R CMD check` to identify any missing imports or symbols. This step helps:

- Automatically detect any functions or symbols from `data.table` that are not explicitly imported.
- Flag missing special symbols like `.N`, `.SD`, and `:=`.
- Provide immediate feedback on what needs to be added to the NAMESPACE file.

Note: Not all such usages are caught by `R CMD check`. In particular, `R CMD check` skips some symbols/functions in formulas and will completely miss parsed expressions like `parse(text = "data.table(a = 1)")`. Packages will need good test coverage to detect these edge cases.

### Step 2.2: Modify the NAMESPACE file

Based on the `R CMD check` results, ensure all used functions, special symbols, S3 generics, and S4 classes from `data.table` are imported.

That means adding `importFrom(data.table, ...)` directives for symbols, functions, and S3 generics, and/or `importClassesFrom(data.table, ...)` directives for S4 classes as appropriate. See 'Writing R Extensions' for full details on how to do so properly.

#### Blanket import

Alternatively, you can import all functions from `data.table` at once, though this is generally not recommended:

```r
import(data.table)
```

**Justification for Avoiding Blanket Imports:**
1. **Documentation**: The NAMESPACE file can serve as good documentation of how you depend on certain packages.
2. **Avoiding Conflicts**: Blanket imports leave you open to subtle breakage. For example, if you `import(pkgA)` and `import(pkgB)`, but later pkgB exports a function also exported by pkgA, this will break your package due to conflicts in your namespace, which is disallowed by `R CMD check` and CRAN.

### Step 3: Update Your R code files outside the package's R/ directory

When you move a package from `Depends` to `Imports`, it will no longer be automatically attached when your package is loaded. This can be important for examples, tests, vignettes, and demos, where `Imports` packages need to be attached explicitly.

**Before (with `Depends`):**
```r
# data.table functions are directly available
library(MyPkgDependsDataTable)
dt <- data.table(x = 1:10, y = letters[1:10])
setDT(dt)
result <- merge(dt, other_dt, by = "x")
```

**After (with `Imports`):**
```r
# Explicitly load data.table in user scripts or vignettes
library(data.table)
library(MyPkgDependsDataTable)
dt <- data.table(x = 1:10, y = letters[1:10])
setDT(dt)
result <- merge(dt, other_dt, by = "x")
```

### Benefits of using `Imports`
- **User-Friendliness*: `Depends` alters your users' `search()` path, possibly without their wanting to do so.
- **Namespace Management**: Only the functions your package explicitly imports are available, reducing the risk of function name clashes.
- **Cleaner Package Loading**: Your package's dependencies are not attached to the search path, making the loading process cleaner and potentially faster.
- **Easier Maintenance**: It simplifies maintenance tasks as upstream dependencies' APIs evolve. Depending too much on `Depends` can lead to conflicts and compatibility issues over time.

<p>This document is focused on using <code>data.table</code> as a dependency in other R packages. If you are interested in using <code>data.table</code> C code from a non-R application, or in calling its C functions directly, jump to the <a href="#non-r-API">last section</a> of this vignette.</p>
<p>Importing <code>data.table</code> is no different from importing other R packages. This vignette is meant to answer the most common questions arising around that subject; the lessons presented here can be applied to other R packages.</p>
<h2 id="why-to-import-data-table">Why to import <code>data.table</code></h2>
<p>One of the biggest features of <code>data.table</code> is its concise syntax which makes exploratory analysis faster and easier to write and perceive; this convenience can drive package authors to use <code>data.table</code>. Another, perhaps more important reason is high performance. When outsourcing heavy computing tasks from your package to <code>data.table</code>, you usually get top performance without needing to re-invent any of these numerical optimization tricks on your own.</p>
<h2 id="importing-data-table-is-easy">Importing <code>data.table</code> is easy</h2>
<p>It is very easy to use <code>data.table</code> as a dependency due to the fact that <code>data.table</code> does not have any of its own dependencies. This applies both to operating system and to R dependencies. It means that if you have R installed on your machine, it already has everything needed to install <code>data.table</code>.  It also means that adding <code>data.table</code> as a dependency of your package will not result in a chain of other recursive dependencies to install, making it very convenient for offline installation.</p>
<h2 id="description-file" DESCRIPTION><code>DESCRIPTION</code> file</h2>
<p>The first place to define a dependency in a package is the <code>DESCRIPTION</code> file. Most commonly, you will need to add <code>data.table</code> under the <code>Imports:</code> field. Doing so will necessitate an installation of <code>data.table</code> before your package can compile/install. As mentioned above, no other packages will be installed because <code>data.table</code> does not have any dependencies of its own. You can also specify the minimal required version of a dependency; for example, if your package is using the <code>fwrite</code> function, which was introduced in <code>data.table</code> in version 1.9.8, you should incorporate this as <code>Imports: data.table (&gt;= 1.9.8)</code>. This way you can ensure that the version of <code>data.table</code> installed is 1.9.8 or later before your users will be able to install your package. Besides the <code>Imports:</code> field, you can also use <code>Depends: data.table</code> but we strongly discourage this approach (and may disallow it in future) because this loads <code>data.table</code> into your userâ€™s workspace; i.e. it enables <code>data.table</code> functionality in your userâ€™s scripts without them requesting that. <code>Imports:</code> is the proper way to use <code>data.table</code> within your package without inflicting <code>data.table</code> on your user. In fact, we hope the <code>Depends:</code> field is eventually deprecated in R since this is true for all packages.</p>
<h2 id="namespace-file" NAMESPACE><code>NAMESPACE</code> file</h2>
<p>The next thing is to define what content of <code>data.table</code> your package is using. This needs to be done in the <code>NAMESPACE</code> file. Most commonly, package authors will want to use <code>import(data.table)</code> which will import all exported (i.e., listed in <code>data.table</code>â€™s own <code>NAMESPACE</code> file) functions from <code>data.table</code>.</p>
<p>You may also want to use just a subset of <code>data.table</code> functions; for example, some packages may simply make use of <code>data.table</code>â€™s high-performance CSV reader and writer, for which you can add <code>importFrom(data.table, fread, fwrite)</code> in your <code>NAMESPACE</code> file. It is also possible to import all functions from a package <em>excluding</em> particular ones using <code>import(data.table, except=c(fread, fwrite))</code>.</p>
<p>Be sure to read also the note about non-standard evaluation in <code>data.table</code> in <a href="#globals">the section on â€œundefined globalsâ€</a></p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>As an example we will define two functions in <code>a.pkg</code> package that uses <code>data.table</code>. One function, <code>gen</code>, will generate a simple <code>data.table</code>; another, <code>aggr</code>, will do a simple aggregation of it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">gen = function (n = 100L) {
  dt = as.data.table(list(id = seq_len(n)))
  dt[, grp := ((id - 1) %% 26) + 1
     ][, grp := letters[grp]
       ][]
}
aggr = function (x) {
  stopifnot(
    is.data.table(x),
    &quot;grp&quot; %in% names(x)
  )
  x[, .N, by = grp]
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>
<p>Be sure to include tests in your package. Before each major release of <code>data.table</code>, we check reverse dependencies. This means that if any changes in <code>data.table</code> would break your code, we will be able to spot breaking changes and inform you before releasing the new version. This of course assumes you will publish your package to CRAN or Bioconductor. The most basic test can be a plaintext R script in your package directory <code>tests/test.R</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">library(a.pkg)
dt = gen()
stopifnot(nrow(dt) == 100)
dt2 = aggr(dt)
stopifnot(nrow(dt2) &lt; 100)
</code></pre>
<p>When testing your package, you may want to use <code>R CMD check --no-stop-on-test-error</code>, which will continue after an error and run all your tests (as opposed to stopping on the first line of script that failed) NB this requires R 3.4.0 or greater.</p>
<h2 id="testing-using-testthat">Testing using <code>testthat</code></h2>
<p>It is very common to use the <code>testthat</code> package for purpose of tests. Testing a package that imports <code>data.table</code> is no different from testing other packages. An example test script <code>tests/testthat/test-pkg.R</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">context(&quot;pkg tests&quot;)

test_that(&quot;generate dt&quot;, { expect_true(nrow(gen()) == 100) })
test_that(&quot;aggregate dt&quot;, { expect_true(nrow(aggr(gen())) &lt; 100) })
</code></pre>
<p>If <code>data.table</code> is in Suggests (but not Imports) then you need to declare <code>.datatable.aware=TRUE</code> in one of the R/* files to avoid â€œobject not foundâ€ errors when testing via <code>testthat::test_package</code> or <code>testthat::test_check</code>.</p>
<h2 id="globals">Dealing with "undefined global functions or variables"</h2>
<p><code>data.table</code>â€˜s use of Râ€™s deferred evaluation (especially on the left-hand side of <code>:=</code>) is not well-recognised by <code>R CMD check</code>. This results in <code>NOTE</code>s like the following during package check:</p>
<pre><code>* checking R code for possible problems ... NOTE
aggr: no visible binding for global variable 'grp'
gen: no visible binding for global variable 'grp'
gen: no visible binding for global variable 'id'
Undefined global functions or variables:
grp id
</code></pre>
<p>The easiest way to deal with this is to pre-define those variables within your package and set them to <code>NULL</code>, optionally adding a comment (as is done in the refined version of <code>gen</code> below). When possible, you could also use a character vector instead of symbols (as in <code>aggr</code> below):</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">gen = function (n = 100L) {
  id = grp = NULL # due to NSE notes in R CMD check
  dt = as.data.table(list(id = seq_len(n)))
  dt[, grp := ((id - 1) %% 26) + 1
     ][, grp := letters[grp]
       ][]
}
aggr = function (x) {
  stopifnot(
    is.data.table(x),
    &quot;grp&quot; %in% names(x)
  )
  x[, .N, by = &quot;grp&quot;]
}
</code></pre>
<p>The case for <code>data.table</code>â€™s special symbols (e.g. <code>.SD</code> and <code>.N</code>) and assignment operator (<code>:=</code>) is slightly different (see <code>?.N</code> for more, including a complete listing of such symbols). You should import whichever of these values you use from <code>data.table</code>â€™s namespace to protect against any issues arising from the unlikely scenario that we change the exported value of these in the future, e.g. if you want to use <code>.N</code>, <code>.I</code>, and <code>:=</code>, a minimal <code>NAMESPACE</code> would have:</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">importFrom(data.table, .N, .I, ':=')
</code></pre>
<p>Much simpler is to just use <code>import(data.table)</code> which will greedily allow usage in your packageâ€™s code of any object exported from <code>data.table</code>.</p>
<p>If you donâ€™t mind having <code>id</code> and <code>grp</code> registered as variables globally in your package namespace you can use <code>?globalVariables</code>. Be aware that these notes do not have any impact on the code or its functionality; if you are not going to publish your package, you may simply choose to ignore them.</p>
<h2 id="care-needed-when-providing-and-using-options">Care needed when providing and using options</h2>
<p>Common practice by R packages is to provide customization options set by <code>options(name=val)</code> and fetched using <code>getOption(&quot;name&quot;, default)</code>. Function arguments often specify a call to <code>getOption()</code> so that the user knows (from <code>?fun</code> or <code>args(fun)</code>) the name of the option controlling the default for that parameter; e.g. <code>fun(..., verbose=getOption(&quot;datatable.verbose&quot;, FALSE))</code>. All <code>data.table</code> options start with <code>datatable.</code> so as to not conflict with options in other packages. A user simply calls <code>options(datatable.verbose=TRUE)</code> to turn on verbosity. This affects all data.table function calls unless <code>verbose=FALSE</code> is provided explicitly; e.g. <code>fun(..., verbose=FALSE)</code>.</p>
<p>The option mechanism in R is <em>global</em>. Meaning that if a user sets a <code>data.table</code> option for their own use, that setting also affects code inside any package that is using <code>data.table</code> too. For an option like <code>datatable.verbose</code>, this is exactly the desired behavior since the desire is to trace and log all <code>data.table</code> operations from wherever they originate; turning on verbosity does not affect the results. Another unique-to-R and excellent-for-production option is Râ€™s <code>options(warn=2)</code> which turns all warnings into errors. Again, the desire is to affect any warning in any package so as to not miss any warnings in production. There are 6 <code>datatable.print.*</code> options and 3 optimization options which do not affect the result of operations. However, there is one <code>data.table</code> option that does and is now a concern: <code>datatable.nomatch</code>. This option changes the default join from outer to inner. [Aside, the default join is outer because outer is safer; it doesnâ€™t drop missing data silently; moreover it is consistent to base R way of matching by names and indices.] Some users prefer inner join to be the default and we provided this option for them. However, a user setting this option can unintentionally change the behavior of joins inside packages that use <code>data.table</code>. Accordingly, in v1.12.4 (Oct 2019) a message was printed when the <code>datatable.nomatch</code> option was used, and from v1.14.2 it is now ignored with warning. It was the only <code>data.table</code> option with this concern.</p>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>If you face any problems in creating a package that uses data.table, please confirm that the problem is reproducible in a clean R session using the R console: <code>R CMD check package.name</code>.</p>
<p>Some of the most common issues developers are facing are usually related to helper tools that are meant to automate some package development tasks, for example, using <code>roxygen</code> to generate your <code>NAMESPACE</code> file from metadata in the R code files. Others are related to helpers that build and check the package. Unfortunately, these helpers sometimes have unintended/hidden side effects which can obscure the source of your troubles. As such, be sure to double check using R console (run R on the command line) and ensure the import is defined in the <code>DESCRIPTION</code> and <code>NAMESPACE</code> files following the <a href="#DESCRIPTION">instructions</a> <a href="#NAMESPACE">above</a>.</p>
<p>If you are not able to reproduce problems you have using the plain R console build and check, you may try to get some support based on past issues weâ€™ve encountered with <code>data.table</code> interacting with helper tools: <a href="https://github.com/r-lib/devtools/issues/192">devtools#192</a> or <a href="https://github.com/r-lib/devtools/issues/1472">devtools#1472</a>.</p>
<h2 id="license">License</h2>
<p>Since version 1.10.5 <code>data.table</code> is licensed as Mozilla Public License (MPL). The reasons for the change from GPL should be read in full <a href="https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/pull/2456">here</a> and you can read more about MPL on Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Public_License">here</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_free_and_open-source_software_licenses">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="optionally-import-data-table-suggests">Optionally import <code>data.table</code>: Suggests</h2>
<p>If you want to use <code>data.table</code> conditionally, i.e., only when it is installed, you should use <code>Suggests: data.table</code> in your <code>DESCRIPTION</code> file instead of using <code>Imports: data.table</code>. By default this definition will not force installation of <code>data.table</code> when installing your package. This also requires you to conditionally use <code>data.table</code> in your package code which should be done using the <code>?requireNamespace</code> function. The below example demonstrates conditional use of <code>data.table</code>â€™s fast CSV writer <code>?fwrite</code>. If the <code>data.table</code> package is not installed, the much-slower base R <code>?write.table</code> function is used instead.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">my.write = function (x) {
  if(requireNamespace(&quot;data.table&quot;, quietly=TRUE)) {
    data.table::fwrite(x, &quot;data.csv&quot;)
  } else {
    write.table(x, &quot;data.csv&quot;)
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>A slightly more extended version of this would also ensure that the installed version of <code>data.table</code> is recent enough to have the <code>fwrite</code> function available:</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">my.write = function (x) {
  if(requireNamespace(&quot;data.table&quot;, quietly=TRUE) &amp;&amp;
    utils::packageVersion(&quot;data.table&quot;) &gt;= &quot;1.9.8&quot;) {
    data.table::fwrite(x, &quot;data.csv&quot;)
  } else {
    write.table(x, &quot;data.csv&quot;)
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>When using a package as a suggested dependency, you should not <code>import</code> it in the <code>NAMESPACE</code> file. Just mention it in the <code>DESCRIPTION</code> file.
When using <code>data.table</code> functions in package code (R/* files) you need to use the <code>data.table::</code> prefix because none of them are imported.
When using <code>data.table</code> in package tests (e.g. tests/testthat/test* files), you need to declare <code>.datatable.aware=TRUE</code> in one of the R/* files.</p>
<h2 id="data-table-in-imports-but-nothing-imported"><code>data.table</code> in <code>Imports</code> but nothing imported</h2>
<p>Some users (<a href="https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/2341">e.g.</a>) may prefer to eschew using <code>importFrom</code> or <code>import</code> in their <code>NAMESPACE</code> file and instead use <code>data.table::</code> qualification on all internal code (of course keeping <code>data.table</code> under their <code>Imports:</code> in <code>DESCRIPTION</code>).</p>
<p>In this case, the un-exported function <code>[.data.table</code> will revert to calling <code>[.data.frame</code> as a safeguard since <code>data.table</code> has no way of knowing that the parent package is aware itâ€™s attempting to make calls against the syntax of <code>data.table</code>â€™s query API (which could lead to unexpected behavior as the structure of calls to <code>[.data.frame</code> and <code>[.data.table</code> fundamentally differ, e.g. the latter has many more arguments).</p>
<p>If this is anyway your preferred approach to package development, please define <code>.datatable.aware = TRUE</code> anywhere in your R source code (no need to export). This tells <code>data.table</code> that you as a package developer have designed your code to intentionally rely on <code>data.table</code> functionality even though it may not be obvious from inspecting your <code>NAMESPACE</code> file.</p>
<p><code>data.table</code> determines on the fly whether the calling function is aware itâ€™s tapping into <code>data.table</code> with the internal <code>cedta</code> function (<strong>C</strong>alling <strong>E</strong>nvironment is <strong>D</strong>ata <strong>T</strong>able <strong>A</strong>ware), which, beyond checking the <code>?getNamespaceImports</code> for your package, also checks the existence of this variable (among other things).</p>

<h3 id="step-2-1-run-r-cmd-check">Step 2.1: Run <code>R CMD check</code></h3>
<p>Run <code>R CMD check</code> to identify any missing imports or symbols. This step helps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatically detect any functions or symbols from <code>data.table</code> that are not explicitly imported.</li>
<li>Flag missing special symbols like <code>.N</code>, <code>.SD</code>, and <code>:=</code>.</li>
<li>Provide immediate feedback on what needs to be added to the NAMESPACE file.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Not all such usages are caught by <code>R CMD check</code>. In particular, <code>R CMD check</code> skips some symbols/functions in formulas and will completely miss parsed expressions like <code>parse(text = &quot;data.table(a = 1)&quot;)</code>. Packages will need good test coverage to detect these edge cases.</p>
<h3 id="step-2-2-modify-the-namespace-file">Step 2.2: Modify the NAMESPACE file</h3>
<p>Based on the <code>R CMD check</code> results, ensure all used functions, special symbols, S3 generics, and S4 classes from <code>data.table</code> are imported.</p>
<p>That means adding <code>importFrom(data.table, ...)</code> directives for symbols, functions, and S3 generics, and/or <code>importClassesFrom(data.table, ...)</code> directives for S4 classes as appropriate. See â€˜Writing R Extensionsâ€™ for full details on how to do so properly.</p>
<h4 id="blanket-import">Blanket import</h4>
<p>Alternatively, you can import all functions from <code>data.table</code> at once, though this is generally not recommended:</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">import(data.table)

<p><strong>Justification for Avoiding Blanket Imports:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Documentation</strong>: The NAMESPACE file can serve as good documentation of how you depend on certain packages.</li>
<li><strong>Avoiding Conflicts</strong>: Blanket imports leave you open to subtle breakage. For example, if you <code>import(pkgA)</code> and <code>import(pkgB)</code>, but later pkgB exports a function also exported by pkgA, this will break your package due to conflicts in your namespace, which is disallowed by <code>R CMD check</code> and CRAN.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="step-3-update-your-r-code-files-outside-the-package-s-r-directory">Step 3: Update Your R code files outside the packageâ€™s R/ directory</h3>
<p>When you move a package from <code>Depends</code> to <code>Imports</code>, it will no longer be automatically attached when your package is loaded. This can be important for examples, tests, vignettes, and demos, where <code>Imports</code> packages need to be attached explicitly.</p>
<p><strong>Before (with <code>Depends</code>):</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-r"># data.table functions are directly available

<li><strong>Cleaner Package Loading</strong>: Your packageâ€™s dependencies are not attached to the search path, making the loading process cleaner and potentially faster.</li>

This vignette introduces the `data.table` syntax, its general form, how to *subset* rows, *select and compute* on columns, and perform aggregations *by group*. Familiarity with the `data.frame` data structure from base R is useful, but not essential to follow this vignette.

***

## Data analysis using `data.table`

Data manipulation operations such as *subset*, *group*, *update*, *join*, etc. are all inherently related. Keeping these *related operations together* allows for:

* *concise* and *consistent* syntax irrespective of the set of operations you would like to perform to achieve your end goal.

* performing analysis *fluidly* without the cognitive burden of having to map each operation to a particular function from a potentially huge set of functions available before performing the analysis.

* *automatically* optimising operations internally and very effectively by knowing precisely the data required for each operation, leading to very fast and memory-efficient code.

Briefly, if you are interested in reducing *programming* and *compute* time tremendously, then this package is for you. The philosophy that `data.table` adheres to makes this possible. Our goal is to illustrate it through this series of vignettes.

## Data {#data}

In this vignette, we will use [NYC-flights14](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rdatatable/data.table/master/vignettes/flights14.csv) data obtained from the [flights](https://github.com/arunsrinivasan/flights) package (available on GitHub only). It contains On-Time flights data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics for all the flights that departed from New York City airports in 2014 (inspired by [nycflights13](https://github.com/tidyverse/nycflights13)). The data is available only for Jan-Oct'14.

We can use `data.table`'s fast-and-friendly file reader `fread` to load `flights` directly as follows:

```{r echo = FALSE}
options(width = 100L)
```

```{r}
input <- if (file.exists("flights14.csv")) {
   "flights14.csv"
} else {
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rdatatable/data.table/master/vignettes/flights14.csv"
}
flights <- fread(input)
flights
dim(flights)
```

Aside: `fread` accepts `http` and `https` URLs directly, as well as operating system commands such as `sed` and `awk` output. See `?fread` for examples.

## Introduction

In this vignette, we will

1. Start with the basics - what is a `data.table`, its general form, how to *subset* rows, how to *select and compute* on columns;

2. Then we will look at performing data aggregations by group

## 1. Basics {#basics-1}

### a) What is `data.table`? {#what-is-datatable-1a}

`data.table` is an R package that provides **an enhanced version** of a `data.frame`, the standard data structure for storing data in `base` R. In the [Data](#data) section above, we saw how to create a `data.table` using `fread()`, but alternatively we can also create one using the `data.table()` function. Here is an example:

```{r}
DT = data.table(
  ID = c("b","b","b","a","a","c"),
  a = 1:6,
  b = 7:12,
  c = 13:18
)
DT
class(DT$ID)
```

You can also convert existing objects to a `data.table` using `setDT()` (for `data.frame` and `list` structures) or `as.data.table()` (for other structures). For more details pertaining to the difference (goes beyond the scope of this vignette), please see `?setDT` and `?as.data.table`.

#### Note that:

* Row numbers are printed with a `:` in order to visually separate the row number from the first column.

* When the number of rows to print exceeds the global option `datatable.print.nrows` (default = `r getOption("datatable.print.nrows")`), it automatically prints only the top 5 and bottom 5 rows (as can be seen in the [Data](#data) section). For a large `data.frame`, you may have found yourself waiting around while larger tables print-and-page, sometimes seemingly endlessly. This restriction helps with that, and you can query the default number like so:

    ```{.r}
    getOption("datatable.print.nrows")
    ```

* `data.table` doesn't set or use *row names*, ever. We will see why in the *"Keys and fast binary search based subset"* vignette.

### b) General form - in what way is a `data.table` *enhanced*? {#enhanced-1b}

In contrast to a `data.frame`, you can do *a lot more* than just subsetting rows and selecting columns within the frame of a `data.table`, i.e., within `[ ... ]` (NB: we might also refer to writing things inside `DT[...]` as "querying `DT`", as an analogy or in relevance to SQL). To understand it we will have to first look at the *general form* of the `data.table` syntax, as shown below:

```{r eval = FALSE}
DT[i, j, by]

##   R:                 i                 j        by
## SQL:  where | order by   select | update  group by
```

Users with an SQL background might perhaps immediately relate to this syntax.

#### The way to read it (out loud) is:

Take `DT`, subset/reorder rows using `i`, then calculate `j`, grouped by `by`.

Let's begin by looking at `i` and `j` first - subsetting rows and operating on columns.

### c) Subset rows in `i` {#subset-i-1c}

#### -- Get all the flights with "JFK" as the origin airport in the month of June.

```{r}
ans <- flights[origin == "JFK" & month == 6L]
head(ans)
```

* Within the frame of a `data.table`, columns can be referred to *as if they are variables*, much like in SQL or Stata. Therefore, we simply refer to `origin` and `month` as if they are variables. We do not need to add the prefix `flights$` each time. Nevertheless, using `flights$origin` and `flights$month` would work just fine.

* The *row indices* that satisfy the condition `origin == "JFK" & month == 6L` are computed, and since there is nothing else left to do, all columns from `flights` at rows corresponding to those *row indices* are simply returned as a `data.table`.

* A comma after the condition in `i` is not required. But `flights[origin == "JFK" & month == 6L, ]` would work just fine. In a `data.frame`, however, the comma is necessary.

#### -- Get the first two rows from `flights`. {#subset-rows-integer}

```{r}
ans <- flights[1:2]
ans
```

* In this case, there is no condition. The row indices are already provided in `i`. We therefore return a `data.table` with all columns from `flights` at rows for those *row indices*.

#### -- Sort `flights` first by column `origin` in *ascending* order, and then by `dest` in *descending* order:

We can use the R function `order()` to accomplish this.

```{r}
ans <- flights[order(origin, -dest)]
head(ans)
```

#### `order()` is internally optimised

* We can use "-" on `character` columns within the frame of a `data.table` to sort in decreasing order.

* In addition, `order(...)` within the frame of a `data.table` uses `data.table`'s internal fast radix order `forder()`. This sort provided such a compelling improvement over R's `base::order` that the R project adopted the `data.table` algorithm as its default sort in 2016 for R 3.3.0 (for reference, check `?sort` and the [R Release NEWS](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/NEWS.pdf)).

We will discuss `data.table`'s fast order in more detail in the *`data.table` internals* vignette.

### d) Select column(s) in `j` {#select-j-1d}

#### -- Select `arr_delay` column, but return it as a *vector*.

```{r}
ans <- flights[, arr_delay]
head(ans)
```

* Since columns can be referred to as if they are variables within the frame of a `data.table`, we directly refer to the *variable* we want to subset. Since we want *all the rows*, we simply skip `i`.

* It returns *all* the rows for the column `arr_delay`.

#### -- Select `arr_delay` column, but return as a `data.table` instead.

```{r}
ans <- flights[, list(arr_delay)]
head(ans)
```

* We wrap the *variables* (column names) within `list()`, which ensures that a `data.table` is returned. In the case of a single column name, not wrapping with `list()` returns a vector instead, as seen in the [previous example](#select-j-1d).

* `data.table` also allows wrapping columns with `.()` instead of `list()`. It is an *alias* to `list()`; they both mean the same. Feel free to use whichever you prefer; we have noticed most users seem to prefer `.()` for conciseness, so we will continue to use `.()` hereafter.

A `data.table` (and a `data.frame` too) is internally a `list` as well, with the stipulation that each element has the same length and the `list` has a `class` attribute. Allowing `j` to return a `list` enables converting and returning `data.table` very efficiently.

#### Tip: {#tip-1}

As long as `j-expression` returns a `list`, each element of the list will be converted to a column in the resulting `data.table`. This makes `j` quite powerful, as we will see shortly. It is also very important to understand this for when you'd like to make more complicated queries!!

#### -- Select both `arr_delay` and `dep_delay` columns.

```{r}
ans <- flights[, .(arr_delay, dep_delay)]
head(ans)

## alternatively
# ans <- flights[, list(arr_delay, dep_delay)]
```

* Wrap both columns within `.()`, or `list()`. That's it.

#### -- Select both `arr_delay` and `dep_delay` columns *and* rename them to `delay_arr` and `delay_dep`.

Since `.()` is just an alias for `list()`, we can name columns as we would while creating a `list`.

```{r}
ans <- flights[, .(delay_arr = arr_delay, delay_dep = dep_delay)]
head(ans)
```

### e) Compute or *do* in `j`

#### -- How many trips have had total delay < 0?

```{r}
ans <- flights[, sum( (arr_delay + dep_delay) < 0 )]
ans
```

#### What's happening here?

* `data.table`'s `j` can handle more than just *selecting columns* - it can handle *expressions*, i.e., *computing on columns*. This shouldn't be surprising, as columns can be referred to as if they are variables. Then we should be able to *compute* by calling functions on those variables. And that's what precisely happens here.

### f) Subset in `i` *and* do in `j`

#### -- Calculate the average arrival and departure delay for all flights with "JFK" as the origin airport in the month of June.

```{r}
ans <- flights[origin == "JFK" & month == 6L,
               .(m_arr = mean(arr_delay), m_dep = mean(dep_delay))]
ans
```

* We first subset in `i` to find matching *row indices* where `origin` airport equals `"JFK"`, and `month` equals `6L`. We *do not* subset the _entire_ `data.table` corresponding to those rows _yet_.

* Now, we look at `j` and find that it uses only *two columns*. And what we have to do is to compute their `mean()`. Therefore, we subset just those columns corresponding to the matching rows, and compute their `mean()`.

Because the three main components of the query (`i`, `j` and `by`) are *together* inside `[...]`, `data.table` can see all three and optimise the query altogether *before evaluation*, rather than optimizing each separately. We are able to therefore avoid the entire subset (i.e., subsetting the columns _besides_ `arr_delay` and `dep_delay`), for both speed and memory efficiency.

#### -- How many trips have been made in 2014 from "JFK" airport in the month of June?

```{r}
ans <- flights[origin == "JFK" & month == 6L, length(dest)]
ans
```

The function `length()` requires an input argument. We just need to compute the number of rows in the subset. We could have used any other column as the input argument to `length()`. This approach is reminiscent of `SELECT COUNT(dest) FROM flights WHERE origin = 'JFK' AND month = 6` in SQL.

This type of operation occurs quite frequently, especially while grouping (as we will see in the next section), to the point where `data.table` provides a *special symbol* `.N` for it.

### g) Handle non-existing elements in `i`

#### -- What happens when querying for non-existing elements?

When querying a `data.table` for elements that do not exist, the behavior differs based on the method used.

```r
setkeyv(flights, "origin")
```

* **Key-based subsetting: `dt["d"]`**

  This performs a right join on the key column `x`, resulting in a row with `d` and `NA` for columns not found. When using `setkeyv`, the table is sorted by the specified keys and an internal index is created, enabling binary search for efficient subsetting.

  ```r
  flights["XYZ"]
  # Returns:
  #    origin year month day dep_time sched_dep_time dep_delay arr_time sched_arr_time arr_delay carrier flight tailnum ...
  # 1:    XYZ   NA    NA  NA       NA             NA        NA       NA             NA        NA      NA     NA      NA ...
  ```

* **Logical subsetting: `dt[x == "d"]`**
  
  This performs a standard subset operation that does not find any matching rows and thus returns an empty `data.table`.

  ```r
    flights[origin == "XYZ"]
  # Returns:
  # Empty data.table (0 rows and 19 cols): year,month,day,dep_time,sched_dep_time,dep_delay,arr_time,sched_arr_time,arr_delay,...
  ```

* **Exact match using `nomatch=NULL`**
  
  For exact matches without `NA` for non-existing elements, use `nomatch=NULL`:

  ```r
  flights["XYZ", nomatch=NULL]
  # Returns:
  # Empty data.table (0 rows and 19 cols): year,month,day,dep_time,sched_dep_time,dep_delay,arr_time,sched_arr_time,arr_delay,...
  ```

Understanding these behaviors can help prevent confusion when dealing with non-existing elements in your data.

#### Special symbol `.N`: {#special-N}

`.N` is a special built-in variable that holds the number of observations _in the current group_. It is particularly useful when combined with `by` as we'll see in the next section. In the absence of group by operations, it simply returns the number of rows in the subset.

Now that we now, we can now accomplish the same task by using `.N` as follows:

```{r}
ans <- flights[origin == "JFK" & month == 6L, .N]
ans
```

* Once again, we subset in `i` to get the *row indices* where `origin` airport equals *"JFK"*, and `month` equals *6*.

* We see that `j` uses only `.N` and no other columns. Therefore, the entire subset is not materialised. We simply return the number of rows in the subset (which is just the length of row indices).

* Note that we did not wrap `.N` with `list()` or `.()`. Therefore, a vector is returned.

We could have accomplished the same operation by doing `nrow(flights[origin == "JFK" & month == 6L])`. However, it would have to subset the entire `data.table` first corresponding to the *row indices* in `i` *and then* return the rows using `nrow()`, which is unnecessary and inefficient. We will cover this and other optimisation aspects in detail under the *`data.table` design* vignette.

### h) Great! But how can I refer to columns by names in `j` (like in a `data.frame`)? {#refer_j}

If you're writing out the column names explicitly, there's no difference compared to a `data.frame` (since v1.9.8).

#### -- Select both `arr_delay` and `dep_delay` columns the `data.frame` way.

```{r j_cols_no_with}
ans <- flights[, c("arr_delay", "dep_delay")]

If you've stored the desired columns in a character vector, there are two options: Using the `..` prefix, or using the `with` argument.

#### -- Select columns named in a variable using the `..` prefix

```{r j_cols_dot_prefix}
select_cols = c("arr_delay", "dep_delay")
flights[ , ..select_cols]
```

For those familiar with the Unix terminal, the `..` prefix should be reminiscent of the "up-one-level" command, which is analogous to what's happening here -- the `..` signals to `data.table` to look for the `select_cols` variable "up-one-level", i.e., within the global environment in this case.

#### -- Select columns named in a variable using `with = FALSE`

```{r j_cols_with}
flights[ , select_cols, with = FALSE]
```

The argument is named `with` after the R function `with()` because of similar functionality. Suppose you have a `data.frame` `DF` and you'd like to subset all rows where `x > 1`. In `base` R you can do the following:

```{r}
DF = data.frame(x = c(1,1,1,2,2,3,3,3), y = 1:8)

## (1) normal way
DF[DF$x > 1, ] # data.frame needs that ',' as well

## (2) using with
DF[with(DF, x > 1), ]
```

* Using `with()` in (2) allows using `DF`'s column `x` as if it were a variable.

    Hence, the argument name `with` in `data.table`. Setting `with = FALSE` disables the ability to refer to columns as if they are variables, thereby restoring the "`data.frame` mode".

* We can also *deselect* columns using `-` or `!`. For example:

    ```{r eval = FALSE}
    ## not run

    # returns all columns except arr_delay and dep_delay
    ans <- flights[, !c("arr_delay", "dep_delay")]
    # or
    ans <- flights[, -c("arr_delay", "dep_delay")]
    ```

* From `v1.9.5+`, we can also select by specifying start and end column names, e.g., `year:day` to select the first three columns.

    ```{r eval = FALSE}
    ## not run

    # returns year,month and day
    ans <- flights[, year:day]
    # returns day, month and year
    ans <- flights[, day:year]
    # returns all columns except year, month and day
    ans <- flights[, -(year:day)]
    ans <- flights[, !(year:day)]
    ```

    This is particularly handy while working interactively.

`with = TRUE` is the default in `data.table` because we can do much more by allowing `j` to handle expressions - especially when combined with `by`, as we'll see in a moment.

## 2. Aggregations

We've already seen `i` and `j` from `data.table`'s general form in the previous section. In this section, we'll see how they can be combined together with `by` to perform operations *by group*. Let's look at some examples.

### a) Grouping using `by`

#### -- How can we get the number of trips corresponding to each origin airport?

```{r}
ans <- flights[, .(.N), by = .(origin)]
ans

## or equivalently using a character vector in 'by'
# ans <- flights[, .(.N), by = "origin"]
```

* We know `.N` [is a special variable](#special-N) that holds the number of rows in the current group. Grouping by `origin` obtains the number of rows, `.N`, for each group.

* By doing `head(flights)` you can see that the origin airports occur in the order *"JFK"*, *"LGA"*, and *"EWR"*. The original order of grouping variables is preserved in the result. _This is important to keep in mind!_

* Since we did not provide a name for the column returned in `j`, it was named `N` automatically by recognising the special symbol `.N`.

* `by` also accepts a character vector of column names. This is particularly useful for coding programmatically, e.g., designing a function with the grouping columns (in the form of a `character` vector) as a function argument.

* When there's only one column or expression to refer to in `j` and `by`, we can drop the `.()` notation. This is purely for convenience. We could instead do:

    ```{r}
    ans <- flights[, .N, by = origin]
    ans
    ```

    We'll use this convenient form wherever applicable hereafter.

#### -- How can we calculate the number of trips for each origin airport for carrier code `"AA"`? {#origin-.N}

The unique carrier code `"AA"` corresponds to *American Airlines Inc.*

```{r}
ans <- flights[carrier == "AA", .N, by = origin]
ans
```

* We first obtain the row indices for the expression `carrier == "AA"` from `i`.

* Using those *row indices*, we obtain the number of rows while grouped by `origin`. Once again no columns are actually materialised here, because the `j-expression` does not require any columns to be actually subsetted and is therefore fast and memory efficient.

#### -- How can we get the total number of trips for each `origin, dest` pair for carrier code `"AA"`? {#origin-dest-.N}

```{r}
ans <- flights[carrier == "AA", .N, by = .(origin, dest)]
head(ans)

## or equivalently using a character vector in 'by'
# ans <- flights[carrier == "AA", .N, by = c("origin", "dest")]
```

* `by` accepts multiple columns. We just provide all the columns by which to group by. Note the use of `.()` again in `by` -- again, this is just shorthand for `list()`, and `list()` can be used here as well. Again, we'll stick with `.()` in this vignette.

#### -- How can we get the average arrival and departure delay for each `orig,dest` pair for each month for carrier code `"AA"`? {#origin-dest-month}

```{r}
ans <- flights[carrier == "AA",
        .(mean(arr_delay), mean(dep_delay)),
        by = .(origin, dest, month)]
ans
```

* Since we did not provide column names for the expressions in `j`, they were automatically generated as `V1` and `V2`.

* Once again, note that the input order of grouping columns is preserved in the result.

Now what if we would like to order the result by those grouping columns `origin`, `dest` and `month`?

### b) Sorted `by`: `keyby`

`data.table` retaining the original order of groups is intentional and by design. There are cases when preserving the original order is essential. But at times we would like to automatically sort by the variables in our grouping.

#### -- So how can we directly order by all the grouping variables?

```{r}
ans <- flights[carrier == "AA",
        .(mean(arr_delay), mean(dep_delay)),
        keyby = .(origin, dest, month)]
ans
```

* All we did was change `by` to `keyby`. This automatically orders the result by the grouping variables in increasing order. In fact, due to the internal implementation of `by` first requiring a sort before recovering the original table's order, `keyby` is typically faster than `by` because it doesn't require this second step.

**Keys:** Actually `keyby` does a little more than *just ordering*. It also *sets a key* after ordering by setting an `attribute` called `sorted`. 

We'll learn more about `keys` in the *Keys and fast binary search based subset* vignette; for now, all you have to know is that you can use `keyby` to automatically order the result by the columns specified in `by`.

### c) Chaining

Let's reconsider the task of [getting the total number of trips for each `origin, dest` pair for carrier *"AA"*](#origin-dest-.N).

```{r}
ans <- flights[carrier == "AA", .N, by = .(origin, dest)]
```

#### -- How can we order `ans` using the columns `origin` in ascending order, and `dest` in descending order?

We can store the intermediate result in a variable, and then use `order(origin, -dest)` on that variable. It seems fairly straightforward.

```{r}
ans <- ans[order(origin, -dest)]
head(ans)
```

* Recall that we can use `-` on a `character` column in `order()` within the frame of a `data.table`. This is possible due to `data.table`'s internal query optimisation.

* Also recall that `order(...)` with the frame of a `data.table` is *automatically optimised* to use `data.table`'s internal fast radix order `forder()` for speed. 

But this requires having to assign the intermediate result and then overwriting that result. We can do one better and avoid this intermediate assignment to a temporary variable altogether by *chaining* expressions.

```{r}
ans <- flights[carrier == "AA", .N, by = .(origin, dest)][order(origin, -dest)]
head(ans, 10)
```

* We can tack expressions one after another, *forming a chain* of operations, i.e., `DT[ ... ][ ... ][ ... ]`.

* Or you can also chain them vertically:

    ```{r eval = FALSE}
    DT[ ...
       ][ ...
         ][ ...
           ]
    ```

### d) Expressions in `by`

#### -- Can `by` accept *expressions* as well or does it just take columns?

Yes it does. As an example, if we would like to find out how many flights started late but arrived early (or on time), started and arrived late etc...

```{r}
ans <- flights[, .N, .(dep_delay>0, arr_delay>0)]
ans
```

* The last row corresponds to `dep_delay > 0 = TRUE` and `arr_delay > 0 = FALSE`. We can see that `r flights[!is.na(arr_delay) & !is.na(dep_delay), .N, .(dep_delay>0, arr_delay>0)][, N[4L]]` flights started late but arrived early (or on time).

* Note that we did not provide any names to `by-expression`. Therefore, names have been automatically assigned in the result. As with `j`, you can name these expressions as you would for elements of any `list`, like for e.g. `DT[, .N, .(dep_delayed = dep_delay>0, arr_delayed = arr_delay>0)]`.

* You can provide other columns along with expressions, for example: `DT[, .N, by = .(a, b>0)]`.

### e) Multiple columns in `j` - `.SD`

#### -- Do we have to compute `mean()` for each column individually?

It is of course not practical to have to type `mean(myCol)` for every column one by one. What if you had 100 columns to average `mean()`?

How can we do this efficiently and concisely? To get there, refresh on [this tip](#tip-1) - *"As long as the `j`-expression returns a `list`, each element of the `list` will be converted to a column in the resulting `data.table`"*. If we can refer to the *data subset for each group* as a variable *while grouping*, we can then loop through all the columns of that variable using the already- or soon-to-be-familiar base function `lapply()`. No new names to learn specific to `data.table`.

#### Special symbol `.SD`: {#special-SD}

`data.table` provides a *special* symbol called `.SD`. It stands for **S**ubset of **D**ata. It by itself is a `data.table` that holds the data for *the current group* defined using `by`.

Recall that a `data.table` is internally a `list` as well with all its columns of equal length.

Let's use the [`data.table` `DT` from before](#what-is-datatable-1a) to get a glimpse of what `.SD` looks like.

```{r}
DT

DT[, print(.SD), by = ID]
```

* `.SD` contains all the columns *except the grouping columns* by default.

* It is also generated by preserving the original order - data corresponding to `ID = "b"`, then `ID = "a"`, and then `ID = "c"`.

To compute on (multiple) columns, we can then simply use the base R function `lapply()`.

```{r}
DT[, lapply(.SD, mean), by = ID]
```

* `.SD` holds the rows corresponding to columns `a`, `b` and `c` for that group. We compute the `mean()` on each of these columns using the already-familiar base function `lapply()`.

* Each group returns a list of three elements containing the mean value which will become the columns of the resulting `data.table`.

* Since `lapply()` returns a `list`, so there is no need to wrap it with an additional `.()` (if necessary, refer to [this tip](#tip-1)).

We are almost there. There is one little thing left to address. In our `flights` `data.table`, we only wanted to calculate the `mean()` of the two columns `arr_delay` and `dep_delay`. But `.SD` would contain all the columns other than the grouping variables by default.

#### -- How can we specify just the columns we would like to compute the `mean()` on?

#### .SDcols

Using the argument `.SDcols`. It accepts either column names or column indices. For example, `.SDcols = c("arr_delay", "dep_delay")` ensures that `.SD` contains only these two columns for each group.

Similar to [part g)](#refer_j), you can also specify the columns to remove instead of columns to keep using `-` or `!`. Additionally, you can select consecutive columns as `colA:colB` and deselect them as `!(colA:colB)` or `-(colA:colB)`.

Now let us try to use `.SD` along with `.SDcols` to get the `mean()` of `arr_delay` and `dep_delay` columns grouped by `origin`, `dest` and `month`.

```{r}
flights[carrier == "AA",                       ## Only on trips with carrier "AA"
        lapply(.SD, mean),                     ## compute the mean
        by = .(origin, dest, month),           ## for every 'origin,dest,month'
        .SDcols = c("arr_delay", "dep_delay")] ## for just those specified in .SDcols
```

### f) Subset `.SD` for each group:

#### -- How can we return the first two rows for each `month`?

```{r}
ans <- flights[, head(.SD, 2), by = month]
head(ans)
```

* `.SD` is a `data.table` that holds all the rows for *that group*. We simply subset the first two rows as we have seen [here](#subset-rows-integer) already.

* For each group, `head(.SD, 2)` returns the first two rows as a `data.table`, which is also a `list`, so we do not have to wrap it with `.()`.

### g) Why keep `j` so flexible?

So that we have a consistent syntax and keep using already existing (and familiar) base functions instead of learning new functions. To illustrate, let us use the `data.table` `DT` that we created at the very beginning under the section [What is a data.table?](#what-is-datatable-1a).

#### -- How can we concatenate columns `a` and `b` for each group in `ID`?

```{r}
DT[, .(val = c(a,b)), by = ID]
```

* That's it. There is no special syntax required. All we need to know is the base function `c()` which concatenates vectors and [the tip from before](#tip-1).

#### -- What if we would like to have all the values of column `a` and `b` concatenated, but returned as a list column?

```{r}
DT[, .(val = list(c(a,b))), by = ID]
```

* Here, we first concatenate the values with `c(a,b)` for each group, and wrap that with `list()`. So for each group, we return a list of all concatenated values.

* Note that those commas are for display only. A list column can contain any object in each cell, and in this example, each cell is itself a vector and some cells contain longer vectors than others.

Once you start internalising usage in `j`, you will realise how powerful the syntax can be. A very useful way to understand it is by playing around, with the help of `print()`.

For example:

```{r}
## look at the difference between
DT[, print(c(a,b)), by = ID] # (1)

## and
DT[, print(list(c(a,b))), by = ID] # (2)
```

In (1), for each group, a vector is returned, with length = 6,4,2 here. However, (2) returns a list of length 1 for each group, with its first element holding vectors of length 6,4,2. Therefore, (1) results in a length of ` 6+4+2 = `r 6+4+2``, whereas (2) returns `1+1+1=`r 1+1+1``.

## Summary

The general form of `data.table` syntax is:

```{r eval = FALSE}
DT[i, j, by]
```

We have seen so far that,

#### Using `i`:

* We can subset rows similar to a `data.frame`- except you don't have to use `DT$` repetitively since columns within the frame of a `data.table` are seen as if they are *variables*.

* We can also sort a `data.table` using `order()`, which internally uses data.table's fast order for better performance.

We can do much more in `i` by keying a `data.table`, which allows for blazing fast subsets and joins. We will see this in the *"Keys and fast binary search based subsets"* and *"Joins and rolling joins"* vignette.

#### Using `j`:

1. Select columns the `data.table` way: `DT[, .(colA, colB)]`.

2. Select columns the `data.frame` way: `DT[, c("colA", "colB")]`.

3. Compute on columns: `DT[, .(sum(colA), mean(colB))]`.

4. Provide names if necessary: `DT[, .(sA =sum(colA), mB = mean(colB))]`.

5. Combine with `i`: `DT[colA > value, sum(colB)]`.

#### Using `by`:

* Using `by`, we can group by columns by specifying a *list of columns* or a *character vector of column names* or even *expressions*. The flexibility of `j`, combined with `by` and `i`, makes for a very powerful syntax.

* `by` can handle multiple columns and also *expressions*.

* We can `keyby` grouping columns to automatically sort the grouped result.

* We can use `.SD` and `.SDcols` in `j` to operate on multiple columns using already familiar base functions. Here are some examples:

    1. `DT[, lapply(.SD, fun), by = ..., .SDcols = ...]` - applies `fun` to all columns specified in `.SDcols` while grouping by the columns specified in `by`.

    2. `DT[, head(.SD, 2), by = ...]` - return the first two rows for each group.

    3. `DT[col > val, head(.SD, 1), by = ...]` - combine `i` along with `j` and `by`.

#### And remember the tip:

As long as `j` returns a `list`, each element of the list will become a column in the resulting `data.table`.

We will see how to *add/update/delete* columns *by reference* and how to combine them with `i` and `by` in the next vignette.

<p>This vignette introduces the <code>data.table</code> syntax, its general form, how to <em>subset</em> rows, <em>select and compute</em> on columns, and perform aggregations <em>by group</em>.

<hr />
<h2 id="data-analysis-using-data-table">Data analysis using <code>data.table</code></h2>
<p>Data manipulation operations such as <em>subset</em>, <em>group</em>, <em>update</em>, <em>join</em>, etc. are all inherently related. Keeping these <em>related operations together</em> allows for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>concise</em> and <em>consistent</em> syntax irrespective of the set of operations you would like to perform to achieve your end goal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>performing analysis <em>fluidly</em> without the cognitive burden of having to map each operation to a particular function from a potentially huge set of functions available before performing the analysis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>automatically</em> optimising operations internally and very effectively by knowing precisely the data required for each operation, leading to very fast and memory-efficient code.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Briefly, if you are interested in reducing <em>programming</em> and <em>compute</em> time tremendously, then this package is for you. The philosophy that <code>data.table</code> adheres to makes this possible. Our goal is to illustrate it through this series of vignettes.</p>
<h2 id="data">Data</h2>
<p>In this vignette, we will use <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rdatatable/data.table/master/vignettes/flights14.csv">NYC-flights14</a> data obtained from the <a href="https://github.com/arunsrinivasan/flights">flights</a> package (available on GitHub only). It contains On-Time flights data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics for all the flights that departed from New York City airports in 2014 (inspired by <a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/nycflights13">nycflights13</a>). The data is available only for Jan-Octâ€™14.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In this vignette, we will</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Start with the basics - what is a <code>data.table</code>, its general form, how to <em>subset</em> rows, how to <em>select and compute</em> on columns;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then we will look at performing data aggregations by group</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="basics-1">1. Basics</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-datatable-1a">a) What is <code>data.table</code>?</h3>
<p><code>data.table</code> is an R package that provides <strong>an enhanced version</strong> of a <code>data.frame</code>, the standard data structure for storing data in <code>base</code> R. In the <a href="#data">Data</a> section above, we saw how to create a <code>data.table</code> using <code>fread()</code>, but alternatively we can also create one using the <code>data.table()</code> function. Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">DT = data.table(
  ID = c(&quot;b&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;a&quot;,&quot;a&quot;,&quot;c&quot;),
  a = 1:6,
  b = 7:12,
  c = 13:18
)
DT
#        ID     a     b     c
#    &lt;char&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;
# 1:      b     1     7    13
# 2:      b     2     8    14
# 3:      b     3     9    15
# 4:      a     4    10    16
# 5:      a     5    11    17
# 6:      c     6    12    18
class(DT$ID)
# [1] &quot;character&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>You can also convert existing objects to a <code>data.table</code> using <code>setDT()</code> (for <code>data.frame</code> and <code>list</code> structures) or <code>as.data.table()</code> (for other structures). For more details pertaining to the difference (goes beyond the scope of this vignette), please see <code>?setDT</code> and <code>?as.data.table</code>.</p>
<h4 id="note-that">Note that:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Row numbers are printed with a <code>:</code> in order to visually separate the row number from the first column.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the number of rows to print exceeds the global option <code>datatable.print.nrows</code> (default = 100), it automatically prints only the top 5 and bottom 5 rows (as can be seen in the <a href="#data">Data</a> section). For a large <code>data.frame</code>, you may have found yourself waiting around while larger tables print-and-page, sometimes seemingly endlessly. This restriction helps with that, and you can query the default number like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">getOption(&quot;datatable.print.nrows&quot;)
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>data.table</code> doesnâ€™t set or use <em>row names</em>, ever. We will see why in the <em>â€œKeys and fast binary search based subsetâ€</em> vignette.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="enhanced-1b">b) General form - in what way is a <code>data.table</code> <em>enhanced</em>?</h3>
<p>In contrast to a <code>data.frame</code>, you can do <em>a lot more</em> than just subsetting rows and selecting columns within the frame of a <code>data.table</code>, i.e., within <code>[ ... ]</code> (NB: we might also refer to writing things inside <code>DT[...]</code> as â€œquerying <code>DT</code>â€, as an analogy or in relevance to SQL). To understand it we will have to first look at the <em>general form</em> of the <code>data.table</code> syntax, as shown below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">DT[i, j, by]

##   R:                 i                 j        by
## SQL:  where | order by   select | update  group by
</code></pre>
<p>Users with an SQL background might perhaps immediately relate to this syntax.</p>
<h4 id="the-way-to-read-it-out-loud-is">The way to read it (out loud) is:</h4>
<p>Take <code>DT</code>, subset/reorder rows using <code>i</code>, then calculate <code>j</code>, grouped by <code>by</code>.</p>
<p>Letâ€™s begin by looking at <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> first - subsetting rows and operating on columns.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Within the frame of a <code>data.table</code>, columns can be referred to <em>as if they are variables</em>, much like in SQL or Stata. Therefore, we simply refer to <code>origin</code> and <code>month</code> as if they are variables. We do not need to add the prefix <code>flights$</code> each time. Nevertheless, using <code>flights$origin</code> and <code>flights$month</code> would work just fine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <em>row indices</em> that satisfy the condition <code>origin == &quot;JFK&quot; &amp; month == 6L</code> are computed, and since there is nothing else left to do, all columns from <code>flights</code> at rows corresponding to those <em>row indices</em> are simply returned as a <code>data.table</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A comma after the condition in <code>i</code> is not required. But <code>flights[origin == &quot;JFK&quot; &amp; month == 6L, ]</code> would work just fine. In a <code>data.frame</code>, however, the comma is necessary.</p>

<h4 id="order-is-internally-optimised"><code>order()</code> is internally optimised</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We can use â€œ-â€ on <code>character</code> columns within the frame of a <code>data.table</code> to sort in decreasing order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition, <code>order(...)</code> within the frame of a <code>data.table</code> uses <code>data.table</code>â€˜s internal fast radix order <code>forder()</code>. This sort provided such a compelling improvement over Râ€™s <code>base::order</code> that the R project adopted the <code>data.table</code> algorithm as its default sort in 2016 for R 3.3.0 (for reference, check <code>?sort</code> and the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/NEWS.pdf">R Release NEWS</a>).</p>

<p>We wrap the <em>variables</em> (column names) within <code>list()</code>, which ensures that a <code>data.table</code> is returned. In the case of a single column name, not wrapping with <code>list()</code> returns a vector instead, as seen in the <a href="#select-j-1d">previous example</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>data.table</code> also allows wrapping columns with <code>.()</code> instead of <code>list()</code>. It is an <em>alias</em> to <code>list()</code>; they both mean the same. Feel free to use whichever you prefer; we have noticed most users seem to prefer <code>.()</code> for conciseness, so we will continue to use <code>.()</code> hereafter.</p>

</ul>
<p>A <code>data.table</code> (and a <code>data.frame</code> too) is internally a <code>list</code> as well, with the stipulation that each element has the same length and the <code>list</code> has a <code>class</code> attribute.

<h4 id="tip-1">Tip:</h4>
<p>As long as <code>j-expression</code> returns a <code>list</code>, each element of the list will be converted to a column in the resulting <code>data.table</code>. This makes <code>j</code> quite powerful, as we will see shortly. It is also very important to understand this for when youâ€™d like to make more complicated queries!!</p>

<p>We first subset in <code>i</code> to find matching <em>row indices</em> where <code>origin</code> airport equals <code>&quot;JFK&quot;</code>, and <code>month</code> equals <code>6L</code>. We <em>do not</em> subset the <em>entire</em> <code>data.table</code> corresponding to those rows <em>yet</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now, we look at <code>j</code> and find that it uses only <em>two columns</em>. And what we have to do is to compute their <code>mean()</code>. Therefore, we subset just those columns corresponding to the matching rows, and compute their <code>mean()</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Because the three main components of the query (<code>i</code>, <code>j</code> and <code>by</code>) are <em>together</em> inside <code>[...]</code>, <code>data.table</code> can see all three and optimise the query altogether <em>before evaluation</em>, rather than optimizing each separately. We are able to therefore avoid the entire subset (i.e., subsetting the columns <em>besides</em> <code>arr_delay</code> and <code>dep_delay</code>), for both speed and memory efficiency.</p>

<p>This performs a right join on the key column <code>x</code>, resulting in a row with <code>d</code> and <code>NA</code> for columns not found.

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Logical subsetting: <code>dt[x == &quot;d&quot;]</code></strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-r">  flights[origin == &quot;XYZ&quot;]

<p>Understanding these behaviors can help prevent confusion when dealing with non-existing elements in your data.</p>
<h4 id="special-N">Special symbol <code>.N</code>:</h4>
<p><code>.N</code> is a special built-in variable that holds the number of observations <em>in the current group</em>. It is particularly useful when combined with <code>by</code> as weâ€™ll see in the next section. In the absence of group by operations, it simply returns the number of rows in the subset.</p>
<p>Now that we now, we can now accomplish the same task by using <code>.N</code> as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">ans &lt;- flights[origin == &quot;JFK&quot; &amp; month == 6L, .N]
ans
# [1] 8422
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Once again, we subset in <code>i</code> to get the <em>row indices</em> where <code>origin</code> airport equals <em>â€œJFKâ€</em>, and <code>month</code> equals <em>6</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We see that <code>j</code> uses only <code>.N</code> and no other columns. Therefore, the entire subset is not materialised. We simply return the number of rows in the subset (which is just the length of row indices).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Note that we did not wrap <code>.N</code> with <code>list()</code> or <code>.()</code>. Therefore, a vector is returned.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We could have accomplished the same operation by doing <code>nrow(flights[origin == &quot;JFK&quot; &amp; month == 6L])</code>. However, it would have to subset the entire <code>data.table</code> first corresponding to the <em>row indices</em> in <code>i</code> <em>and then</em> return the rows using <code>nrow()</code>, which is unnecessary and inefficient. We will cover this and other optimisation aspects in detail under the <em><code>data.table</code> design</em> vignette.</p>

<p>For those familiar with the Unix terminal, the <code>..</code> prefix should be reminiscent of the â€œup-one-levelâ€ command, which is analogous to whatâ€™s happening here â€“ the <code>..</code> signals to <code>data.table</code> to look for the <code>select_cols</code> variable â€œup-one-levelâ€, i.e., within the global environment in this case.</p>

<p>The argument is named <code>with</code> after the R function <code>with()</code> because of similar functionality. Suppose you have a <code>data.frame</code> <code>DF</code> and youâ€™d like to subset all rows where <code>x &gt; 1</code>. In <code>base</code> R you can do the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">DF = data.frame(x = c(1,1,1,2,2,3,3,3), y = 1:8)

## (1) normal way
DF[DF$x &gt; 1, ] # data.frame needs that ',' as well
#   x y
# 4 2 4
# 5 2 5
# 6 3 6
# 7 3 7
# 8 3 8

## (2) using with
DF[with(DF, x &gt; 1), ]
#   x y
# 4 2 4
# 5 2 5
# 6 3 6
# 7 3 7
# 8 3 8
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Using <code>with()</code> in (2) allows using <code>DF</code>â€™s column <code>x</code> as if it were a variable.</p>
<p>Hence, the argument name <code>with</code> in <code>data.table</code>. Setting <code>with = FALSE</code> disables the ability to refer to columns as if they are variables, thereby restoring the â€œ<code>data.frame</code> modeâ€.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can also <em>deselect</em> columns using <code>-</code> or <code>!</code>. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">## not run

# returns all columns except arr_delay and dep_delay
ans &lt;- flights[, !c(&quot;arr_delay&quot;, &quot;dep_delay&quot;)]
# or
ans &lt;- flights[, -c(&quot;arr_delay&quot;, &quot;dep_delay&quot;)]
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>From <code>v1.9.5+</code>, we can also select by specifying start and end column names, e.g., <code>year:day</code> to select the first three columns.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">## not run

# returns year,month and day
ans &lt;- flights[, year:day]
# returns day, month and year
ans &lt;- flights[, day:year]
# returns all columns except year, month and day
ans &lt;- flights[, -(year:day)]
ans &lt;- flights[, !(year:day)]
</code></pre>
<p>This is particularly handy while working interactively.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><code>with = TRUE</code> is the default in <code>data.table</code> because we can do much more by allowing <code>j</code> to handle expressions - especially when combined with <code>by</code>, as weâ€™ll see in a moment.</p>
<h2 id="2-aggregations">2. Aggregations</h2>
<p>Weâ€™ve already seen <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> from <code>data.table</code>â€˜s general form in the previous section. In this section, weâ€™ll see how they can be combined together with <code>by</code> to perform operations <em>by group</em>. Letâ€™s look at some examples.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>We know <code>.N</code> <a href="#special-N">is a special variable</a> that holds the number of rows in the current group. Grouping by <code>origin</code> obtains the number of rows, <code>.N</code>, for each group.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By doing <code>head(flights)</code> you can see that the origin airports occur in the order <em>â€œJFKâ€</em>, <em>â€œLGAâ€</em>, and <em>â€œEWRâ€</em>. The original order of grouping variables is preserved in the result. <em>This is important to keep in mind!</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since we did not provide a name for the column returned in <code>j</code>, it was named <code>N</code> automatically by recognising the special symbol <code>.N</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>by</code> also accepts a character vector of column names. This is particularly useful for coding programmatically, e.g., designing a function with the grouping columns (in the form of a <code>character</code> vector) as a function argument.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When thereâ€™s only one column or expression to refer to in <code>j</code> and <code>by</code>, we can drop the <code>.()</code> notation. This is purely for convenience. We could instead do:</p>

<li>All we did was change <code>by</code> to <code>keyby</code>. This automatically orders the result by the grouping variables in increasing order.

<p><strong>Keys:</strong> Actually <code>keyby</code> does a little more than <em>just ordering</em>. It also <em>sets a key</em> after ordering by setting an <code>attribute</code> called <code>sorted</code>.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Recall that we can use <code>-</code> on a <code>character</code> column in <code>order()</code> within the frame of a <code>data.table</code>. This is possible due to <code>data.table</code>â€™s internal query optimisation.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><code>.SD</code> contains all the columns <em>except the grouping columns</em> by default.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is also generated by preserving the original order - data corresponding to <code>ID = &quot;b&quot;</code>, then <code>ID = &quot;a&quot;</code>, and then <code>ID = &quot;c&quot;</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To compute on (multiple) columns, we can then simply use the base R function <code>lapply()</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">DT[, lapply(.SD, mean), by = ID]
#        ID     a     b     c
#    &lt;char&gt; &lt;num&gt; &lt;num&gt; &lt;num&gt;

# 2:      a   4.5  10.5  16.5
# 3:      c   6.0  12.0  18.0
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>.SD</code> holds the rows corresponding to columns <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> for that group. We compute the <code>mean()</code> on each of these columns using the already-familiar base function <code>lapply()</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each group returns a list of three elements containing the mean value which will become the columns of the resulting <code>data.table</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since <code>lapply()</code> returns a <code>list</code>, so there is no need to wrap it with an additional <code>.()</code> (if necessary, refer to <a href="#tip-1">this tip</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We are almost there. There is one little thing left to address. In our <code>flights</code> <code>data.table</code>, we only wanted to calculate the <code>mean()</code> of the two columns <code>arr_delay</code> and <code>dep_delay</code>. But <code>.SD</code> would contain all the columns other than the grouping variables by default.</p>
<h4 id="how-can-we-specify-just-the-columns-we-would-like-to-compute-the-mean-on">â€“ How can we specify just the columns we would like to compute the <code>mean()</code> on?</h4>
<h4 id="sdcols">.SDcols</h4>
<p>Using the argument <code>.SDcols</code>. It accepts either column names or column indices. For example, <code>.SDcols = c(&quot;arr_delay&quot;, &quot;dep_delay&quot;)</code> ensures that <code>.SD</code> contains only these two columns for each group.</p>
<p>Similar to <a href="#refer_j">part g)</a>, you can also specify the columns to remove instead of columns to keep using <code>-</code> or <code>!</code>. Additionally, you can select consecutive columns as <code>colA:colB</code> and deselect them as <code>!(colA:colB)</code> or <code>-(colA:colB)</code>.</p>
<p>Now let us try to use <code>.SD</code> along with <code>.SDcols</code> to get the <code>mean()</code> of <code>arr_delay</code> and <code>dep_delay</code> columns grouped by <code>origin</code>, <code>dest</code> and <code>month</code>.</p>

<p><code>.SD</code> is a <code>data.table</code> that holds all the rows for <em>that group</em>. We simply subset the first two rows as we have seen <a href="#subset-rows-integer">here</a> already.</p>

<li>
<p>For each group, <code>head(.SD, 2)</code> returns the first two rows as a <code>data.table</code>, which is also a <code>list</code>, so we do not have to wrap it with <code>.()</code>.</p>

<h3 id="g-why-keep-j-so-flexible">g) Why keep <code>j</code> so flexible?</h3>
<p>So that we have a consistent syntax and keep using already existing (and familiar) base functions instead of learning new functions.

<ul>
<li>Thatâ€™s it. There is no special syntax required. All we need to know is the base function <code>c()</code> which concatenates vectors and <a href="#tip-1">the tip from before</a>.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Here, we first concatenate the values with <code>c(a,b)</code> for each group, and wrap that with <code>list()</code>. So for each group, we return a list of all concatenated values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Note that those commas are for display only. A list column can contain any object in each cell, and in this example, each cell is itself a vector and some cells contain longer vectors than others.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you start internalising usage in <code>j</code>, you will realise how powerful the syntax can be. A very useful way to understand it is by playing around, with the help of <code>print()</code>.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">## look at the difference between
DT[, print(c(a,b)), by = ID] # (1)
# [1] 1 2 3 7 8 9
# [1]  4  5 10 11
# [1]  6 12
# Empty data.table (0 rows and 1 cols): ID

## and
DT[, print(list(c(a,b))), by = ID] # (2)
# [[1]]
# [1] 1 2 3 7 8 9
# 
# [[1]]
# [1]  4  5 10 11
# 
# [[1]]
# [1]  6 12
# Empty data.table (0 rows and 1 cols): ID
</code></pre>
<p>In (1), for each group, a vector is returned, with length = 6,4,2 here. However, (2) returns a list of length 1 for each group, with its first element holding vectors of length 6,4,2. Therefore, (1) results in a length of <code> 6+4+2 = 12</code>, whereas (2) returns <code>1+1+1=3</code>.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The general form of <code>data.table</code> syntax is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">DT[i, j, by]
</code></pre>
<p>We have seen so far that,</p>
<h4 id="using-i">Using <code>i</code>:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We can subset rows similar to a <code>data.frame</code>- except you donâ€™t have to use <code>DT$</code> repetitively since columns within the frame of a <code>data.table</code> are seen as if they are <em>variables</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can also sort a <code>data.table</code> using <code>order()</code>, which internally uses data.tableâ€™s fast order for better performance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We can do much more in <code>i</code> by keying a <code>data.table</code>, which allows for blazing fast subsets and joins. We will see this in the <em>â€œKeys and fast binary search based subsetsâ€</em> and <em>â€œJoins and rolling joinsâ€</em> vignette.</p>
<h4 id="using-j">Using <code>j</code>:</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Select columns the <code>data.table</code> way: <code>DT[, .(colA, colB)]</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select columns the <code>data.frame</code> way: <code>DT[, c(&quot;colA&quot;, &quot;colB&quot;)]</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compute on columns: <code>DT[, .(sum(colA), mean(colB))]</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide names if necessary: <code>DT[, .(sA =sum(colA), mB = mean(colB))]</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Combine with <code>i</code>: <code>DT[colA &gt; value, sum(colB)]</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="using-by">Using <code>by</code>:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Using <code>by</code>, we can group by columns by specifying a <em>list of columns</em> or a <em>character vector of column names</em> or even <em>expressions</em>. The flexibility of <code>j</code>, combined with <code>by</code> and <code>i</code>, makes for a very powerful syntax.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>by</code> can handle multiple columns and also <em>expressions</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can <code>keyby</code> grouping columns to automatically sort the grouped result.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can use <code>.SD</code> and <code>.SDcols</code> in <code>j</code> to operate on multiple columns using already familiar base functions. Here are some examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><code>DT[, lapply(.SD, fun), by = ..., .SDcols = ...]</code> - applies <code>fun</code> to all columns specified in <code>.SDcols</code> while grouping by the columns specified in <code>by</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>DT[, head(.SD, 2), by = ...]</code> - return the first two rows for each group.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>DT[col &gt; val, head(.SD, 1), by = ...]</code> - combine <code>i</code> along with <code>j</code> and <code>by</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="and-remember-the-tip">And remember the tip:</h4>
<p>As long as <code>j</code> returns a <code>list</code>, each element of the list will become a column in the resulting <code>data.table</code>.</p>
<p>We will see how to <em>add/update/delete</em> columns <em>by reference</em> and how to combine them with <code>i</code> and <code>by</code> in the next vignette.</p>

This vignette is aimed at those who are already familiar with *data.table* syntax, its general form, how to subset rows in `i`, select and compute on columns, add/modify/delete columns *by reference* in `j` and group by using `by`. If you're not familiar with these concepts, please read the *"Introduction to data.table"* and *"Reference semantics"* vignettes first.

## Data {#data}

We will use the same `flights` data as in the *"Introduction to data.table"* vignette.

```{r echo = FALSE}
options(width = 100L)
```

```{r}
flights <- fread("flights14.csv")
head(flights)
dim(flights)
```

## Introduction

In this vignette, we will

* first introduce the concept of `key` in *data.table*, and set and use keys to perform *fast binary search* based subsets in `i`,

* see that we can combine key based subsets along with `j` and `by` in the exact same way as before,

* look at other additional useful arguments - `mult` and `nomatch`,

* and finally conclude by looking at the advantage of setting keys - perform *fast binary search based subsets* and compare with the traditional vector scan approach.

## 1. Keys

### a) What is a *key*?

In the *"Introduction to data.table"* vignette, we saw how to subset rows in `i` using logical expressions, row numbers and using `order()`. In this section, we will look at another way of subsetting incredibly fast - using *keys*.

But first, let's start by looking at *data.frames*. All *data.frames* have a row names attribute. Consider the *data.frame* `DF` below.

```{r}
set.seed(1L)
DF = data.frame(ID1 = sample(letters[1:2], 10, TRUE),
                ID2 = sample(1:3, 10, TRUE),
                val = sample(10),
                stringsAsFactors = FALSE,
                row.names = sample(LETTERS[1:10]))
DF

rownames(DF)
```

We can *subset* a particular row using its row name as shown below:

```{r}
DF["C", ]
```

i.e., row names are more or less *an index* to rows of a *data.frame*. However,

1. Each row is limited to *exactly one* row name.

    But, a person (for example) has at least two names - a *first* and a *second* name. It is useful to organise a telephone directory by *surname* then *first name*.

2. And row names should be *unique*.

    ```{r eval = FALSE}
    rownames(DF) = sample(LETTERS[1:5], 10, TRUE)
    # Warning: non-unique values when setting 'row.names': 'C', 'D'
    # Error in `.rowNamesDF<-`(x, value = value): duplicate 'row.names' are not allowed
    ```

Now let's convert it to a *data.table*.

```{r}
DT = as.data.table(DF)
DT

rownames(DT)
```

* Note that row names have been reset.

* *data.tables* never uses row names. Since *data.tables* **inherit** from *data.frames*, it still has the row names attribute. But it never uses them. We'll see in a moment as to why.

    If you would like to preserve the row names, use `keep.rownames = TRUE` in `as.data.table()` - this will create a new column called `rn` and assign row names to this column.

Instead, in *data.tables* we set and use `keys`. Think of a `key` as **supercharged rownames**.

#### Keys and their properties {#key-properties}

1. We can set keys on *multiple columns* and the column can be of *different types* -- *integer*, *numeric*, *character*, *factor*, *integer64* etc. *list* and *complex* types are not supported yet.

2. Uniqueness is not enforced, i.e., duplicate key values are allowed. Since rows are sorted by key, any duplicates in the key columns will appear consecutively.

3. Setting a `key` does *two* things:

    a. physically reorders the rows of the *data.table* by the column(s) provided *by reference*, always in *increasing* order.

    b. marks those columns as *key* columns by setting an attribute called `sorted` to the *data.table*.

    Since the rows are reordered, a *data.table* can have at most one key because it can not be sorted in more than one way.

For the rest of the vignette, we will work with `flights` data set.

### b) Set, get and use keys on a *data.table*

#### -- How can we set the column `origin` as key in the *data.table* `flights`?

```{r}
setkey(flights, origin)
head(flights)

## alternatively we can provide character vectors to the function 'setkeyv()'
# setkeyv(flights, "origin") # useful to program with
```

* You can use the function `setkey()` and provide the column names (without quoting them). This is helpful during interactive use.

* Alternatively you can pass a character vector of column names to the function `setkeyv()`. This is particularly useful while designing functions to pass columns to set key on as function arguments.

* Note that we did not have to assign the result back to a variable. This is because like the `:=` function we saw in the *"Reference semantics"* vignette, `setkey()` and `setkeyv()` modify the input *data.table* *by reference*. They return the result invisibly.

* The *data.table* is now reordered (or sorted) by the column we provided - `origin`. Since we reorder by reference, we only require additional memory of one column of length equal to the number of rows in the *data.table*, and is therefore very memory efficient.

* You can also set keys directly when creating *data.tables* using the `data.table()` function using `key` argument. It takes a character vector of column names.

#### set* and `:=`:

In *data.table*, the `:=` operator and all the `set*` (e.g., `setkey`, `setorder`, `setnames` etc.) functions are the only ones which modify the input object *by reference*.

Once you *key* a *data.table* by certain columns, you can subset by querying those key columns using the `.()` notation in `i`. Recall that `.()` is an *alias to* `list()`.

#### -- Use the key column `origin` to subset all rows where the origin airport matches *"JFK"*

```{r}
flights[.("JFK")]

## alternatively
# flights[J("JFK")] (or)
# flights[list("JFK")]
```

* The *key* column has already been set to `origin`. So it is sufficient to provide the value, here *"JFK"*, directly. The `.()` syntax helps identify that the task requires looking up the value *"JFK"* in the key column of *data.table* (here column `origin` of `flights` *data.table*).

* The *row indices* corresponding to the value *"JFK"* in `origin` is obtained first. And since there is no expression in `j`, all columns corresponding to those row indices are returned.

* On single column key of *character* type, you can drop the `.()` notation and use the values directly when subsetting, like subset using row names on *data.frames*.

    ```{r eval = FALSE}
    flights["JFK"]              ## same as flights[.("JFK")]
    ```

* We can subset any amount of values as required

    ```{r eval = FALSE}
    flights[c("JFK", "LGA")]    ## same as flights[.(c("JFK", "LGA"))]
    ```

    This returns all columns corresponding to those rows where `origin` column matches either *"JFK"* or *"LGA"*.

#### -- How can we get the column(s) a *data.table* is keyed by?

Using the function `key()`.

```{r}
key(flights)
```

* It returns a character vector of all the key columns.

* If no key is set, it returns `NULL`.

### c) Keys and multiple columns

To refresh, *keys* are like *supercharged* row names. We can set key on multiple columns and they can be of multiple types.

#### -- How can I set keys on both `origin` *and* `dest` columns?

```{r}
setkey(flights, origin, dest)
head(flights)

## or alternatively
# setkeyv(flights, c("origin", "dest")) # provide a character vector of column names

key(flights)
```

* It sorts the *data.table* first by the column `origin` and then by `dest` *by reference*.

#### -- Subset all rows using key columns where first key column `origin` matches *"JFK"* and second key column `dest` matches *"MIA"*

```{r}
flights[.("JFK", "MIA")]
```

#### How does the subset work here? {#multiple-key-point}

* It is important to understand how this works internally. *"JFK"* is first matched against the first key column `origin`. And *within those matching rows*, *"MIA"* is matched against the second key column `dest` to obtain *row indices* where both `origin` and `dest` match the given values.

* Since no `j` is provided, we simply return *all columns* corresponding to those row indices.

#### -- Subset all rows where just the first key column `origin` matches *"JFK"*

```{r}
key(flights)

flights[.("JFK")] ## or in this case simply flights["JFK"], for convenience
```

* Since we did not provide any values for the second key column `dest`, it just matches *"JFK"* against the first key column `origin` and returns all the matched rows.

#### -- Subset all rows where just the second key column `dest` matches *"MIA"*

```{r}
flights[.(unique(origin), "MIA")]
```

#### What's happening here?

* Read [this](#multiple-key-point) again. The value provided for the second key column *"MIA"* has to find the matching values in `dest` key column *on the matching rows provided by the first key column `origin`*. We can not skip the values of key columns *before*. Therefore, we provide *all* unique values from key column `origin`.

* *"MIA"* is automatically recycled to fit the length of `unique(origin)` which is *3*.

## 2. Combining keys with `j` and `by`

All we have seen so far is the same concept -- obtaining *row indices* in `i`, but just using a different method -- using `keys`. It shouldn't be surprising that we can do exactly the same things in `j` and `by` as seen from the previous vignettes. We will highlight this with a few examples.

### a) Select in `j`

#### -- Return `arr_delay` column as a *data.table* corresponding to `origin = "LGA"` and `dest = "TPA"`.

```{r}
key(flights)
flights[.("LGA", "TPA"), .(arr_delay)]
```

* The *row indices* corresponding to `origin == "LGA"` and `dest == "TPA"` are obtained using *key based subset*.

* Once we have the row indices, we look at `j` which requires only the `arr_delay` column. So we simply select the column `arr_delay` for those *row indices* in the exact same way as we have seen in *Introduction to data.table* vignette.

* We could have returned the result by using `with = FALSE` as well.

    ```{r eval = FALSE}
    flights[.("LGA", "TPA"), "arr_delay", with = FALSE]
    ```

### b) Chaining

#### -- On the result obtained above, use chaining to order the column in decreasing order.

```{r}
flights[.("LGA", "TPA"), .(arr_delay)][order(-arr_delay)]
```

### c) Compute or *do* in `j`

#### -- Find the maximum arrival delay corresponding to `origin = "LGA"` and `dest = "TPA"`.

```{r}
flights[.("LGA", "TPA"), max(arr_delay)]
```

* We can verify that the result is identical to first value (486) from the previous example.

### d) *sub-assign* by reference using `:=` in `j`

We have seen this example already in the *Reference semantics* vignette. Let's take a look at all the `hours` available in the `flights` *data.table*:

```{r}
# get all 'hours' in flights
flights[, sort(unique(hour))]
```

We see that there are totally `25` unique values in the data. Both *0* and *24* hours seem to be present. Let's go ahead and replace *24* with *0*, but this time using *key*.

```{r}
setkey(flights, hour)
key(flights)
flights[.(24), hour := 0L]
key(flights)
```

* We first set `key` to `hour`. This reorders `flights` by the column `hour` and marks that column as the `key` column.

* Now we can subset on `hour` by using the `.()` notation. We subset for the value *24* and obtain the corresponding *row indices*.

* And on those row indices, we replace the `key` column with the value `0`.

* Since we have replaced values on the *key* column, the *data.table* `flights` isn't sorted by `hour` anymore. Therefore, the key has been automatically removed by setting to NULL.

Now, there shouldn't be any *24* in the `hour` column.

```{r}
flights[, sort(unique(hour))]
```

### e) Aggregation using `by`

Let's set the key back to `origin, dest` first.

```{r}
setkey(flights, origin, dest)
key(flights)
```

#### -- Get the maximum departure delay for each `month` corresponding to `origin = "JFK"`. Order the result by `month`

```{r}
ans <- flights["JFK", max(dep_delay), keyby = month]
head(ans)
key(ans)
```

* We subset on the `key` column *origin* to obtain the *row indices* corresponding to *"JFK"*.

* Once we obtain the row indices, we only need two columns - `month` to group by and `dep_delay` to obtain `max()` for each group. *data.table's* query optimisation therefore subsets just those two columns corresponding to the *row indices* obtained in `i`, for speed and memory efficiency.

* And on that subset, we group by *month* and compute `max(dep_delay)`.

* We use `keyby` to automatically key that result by *month*. Now we understand what that means. In addition to ordering, it also sets *month* as the `key` column.

## 3. Additional arguments - `mult` and `nomatch`

### a) The *mult* argument

We can choose, for each query, if *"all"* the matching rows should be returned, or just the *"first"* or *"last"* using the `mult` argument. The default value is *"all"* - what we've seen so far.

#### -- Subset only the first matching row from all rows where `origin` matches *"JFK"* and `dest` matches *"MIA"*

```{r}
flights[.("JFK", "MIA"), mult = "first"]
```

#### -- Subset only the last matching row of all the rows where `origin` matches *"LGA", "JFK", "EWR"* and `dest` matches *"XNA"*

```{r}
flights[.(c("LGA", "JFK", "EWR"), "XNA"), mult = "last"]
```

* The query *"JFK", "XNA"* doesn't match any rows in `flights` and therefore returns `NA`.

* Once again, the query for second key column `dest`,  *"XNA"*, is recycled to fit the length of the query for first key column `origin`, which is of length 3.

### b) The *nomatch* argument

We can choose if queries that do not match should return `NA` or be skipped altogether using the `nomatch` argument.

#### -- From the previous example, Subset all rows only if there's a match

```{r}
flights[.(c("LGA", "JFK", "EWR"), "XNA"), mult = "last", nomatch = NULL]
```

* Default value for `nomatch` is `NA`. Setting `nomatch = NULL` skips queries with no matches.

* The query â€œJFKâ€, â€œXNAâ€ doesnâ€™t match any rows in flights and therefore is skipped.

## 4. binary search vs vector scans

We have seen so far how we can set and use keys to subset. But what's the advantage? For example, instead of doing:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# key by origin,dest columns
flights[.("JFK", "MIA")]
```

we could have done:

```{r eval = FALSE}
flights[origin == "JFK" & dest == "MIA"]
```

One advantage very likely is shorter syntax. But even more than that, *binary search based subsets* are **incredibly fast**.  

As the time goes `data.table` gets new optimization and currently the latter call is automatically optimized to use *binary search*.  
To use slow *vector scan* key needs to be removed.  

```{r eval = FALSE}
setkey(flights, NULL)
flights[origin == "JFK" & dest == "MIA"]
```

### a) Performance of binary search approach

To illustrate, let's create a sample *data.table* with 20 million rows and three columns and key it by columns `x` and `y`.

```{r}
set.seed(2L)
N = 2e7L
DT = data.table(x = sample(letters, N, TRUE),
                y = sample(1000L, N, TRUE),
                val = runif(N))
print(object.size(DT), units = "Mb")
```

`DT` is ~380MB. It is not really huge, but this will do to illustrate the point.

From what we have seen in the Introduction to data.table section, we can subset those rows where columns `x = "g"` and `y = 877` as follows:

```{r}
key(DT)
## (1) Usual way of subsetting - vector scan approach
t1 <- system.time(ans1 <- DT[x == "g" & y == 877L])
t1
head(ans1)
dim(ans1)
```

Now let's try to subset by using keys.

```{r}
setkeyv(DT, c("x", "y"))
key(DT)
## (2) Subsetting using keys
t2 <- system.time(ans2 <- DT[.("g", 877L)])
t2
head(ans2)
dim(ans2)

identical(ans1$val, ans2$val)
```

* The speed-up is **~`r round(t1[3]/max(t2[3], .001))`x**!

### b) Why does keying a *data.table* result in blazing fast subsets?

To understand that, let's first look at what *vector scan approach* (method 1) does.

#### Vector scan approach

* The column `x` is searched for the value *"g"* row by row, on all 20 million of them. This results in a *logical vector* of size 20 million, with values `TRUE, FALSE or NA` corresponding to `x`'s value.

* Similarly, the column `y` is searched for `877` on all 20 million rows one by one, and stored in another logical vector.

* Element wise `&` operations are performed on the intermediate logical vectors and all the rows where the expression evaluates to `TRUE` are returned.

This is what we call a *vector scan approach*. And this is quite inefficient, especially on larger tables and when one needs repeated subsetting, because it has to scan through all the rows each time.

Now let us look at binary search approach (method 2). Recall from [Properties of key](#key-properties) - *setting keys reorders the data.table by key columns*. Since the data is sorted, we don't have to *scan through the entire length of the column*! We can instead use *binary search* to search a value in `O(log n)` as opposed to `O(n)` in case of *vector scan approach*, where `n` is the number of rows in the *data.table*.

#### Binary search approach

Here's a very simple illustration. Let's consider the (sorted) numbers shown below:

```
1, 5, 10, 19, 22, 23, 30
```

Suppose we'd like to find the matching position of the value *1*, using binary search, this is how we would proceed - because we know that the data is *sorted*.

* Start with the middle value = 19. Is 1 == 19? No. 1 < 19.

* Since the value we're looking for is smaller than 19, it should be somewhere before 19. So we can discard the rest of the half that are >= 19.

* Our set is now reduced to *1, 5, 10*. Grab the middle value once again = 5. Is 1 == 5? No. 1 < 5.

* Our set is reduced to *1*. Is 1 == 1? Yes. The corresponding index is also 1. And that's the only match.

A vector scan approach on the other hand would have to scan through all the values (here, 7).

It can be seen that with every search we reduce the number of searches by half. This is why *binary search* based subsets are **incredibly fast**. Since rows of each column of *data.tables* have contiguous locations in memory, the operations are performed in a very cache efficient manner (also contributes to *speed*).

In addition, since we obtain the matching row indices directly without having to create those huge logical vectors (equal to the number of rows in a *data.table*), it is quite **memory efficient** as well.

## Summary

In this vignette, we have learnt another method to subset rows in `i` by keying a *data.table*. Setting keys allows us to perform blazing fast subsets by using *binary search*. In particular, we have seen how to

* set key and subset using the key on a *data.table*.

* subset using keys which fetches *row indices* in `i`, but much faster.

* combine key based subsets with `j` and `by`. Note that the `j` and `by` operations are exactly the same as before.

Key based subsets are **incredibly fast** and are particularly useful when the task involves *repeated subsetting*. But it may not be always desirable to set key and physically reorder the *data.table*. In the next vignette, we will address this using a *new* feature -- *secondary indexes*.

<h2 id="1-keys">1. Keys</h2>
<h3 id="a-what-is-a-key">a) What is a <em>key</em>?</h3>
<p>In the <em>â€œIntroduction to data.tableâ€</em> vignette, we saw how to subset rows in <code>i</code> using logical expressions, row numbers and using <code>order()</code>. In this section, we will look at another way of subsetting incredibly fast - using <em>keys</em>.</p>
<p>But first, letâ€™s start by looking at <em>data.frames</em>. All <em>data.frames</em> have a row names attribute. Consider the <em>data.frame</em> <code>DF</code> below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">set.seed(1L)
DF = data.frame(ID1 = sample(letters[1:2], 10, TRUE),
                ID2 = sample(1:3, 10, TRUE),
                val = sample(10),
                stringsAsFactors = FALSE,
                row.names = sample(LETTERS[1:10]))
DF
#   ID1 ID2 val
# I   a   1  10
# D   a   3   9
# G   a   1   4
# A   a   1   7
# B   a   1   1
# E   b   1   8
# C   b   2   3
# J   b   1   2
# F   b   1   5
# H   a   2   6

rownames(DF)
#  [1] &quot;I&quot; &quot;D&quot; &quot;G&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;E&quot; &quot;C&quot; &quot;J&quot; &quot;F&quot; &quot;H&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>We can <em>subset</em> a particular row using its row name as shown below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">DF[&quot;C&quot;, ]
#   ID1 ID2 val
# C   b   2   3
</code></pre>
<p>i.e., row names are more or less <em>an index</em> to rows of a <em>data.frame</em>. However,</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Each row is limited to <em>exactly one</em> row name.</p>
<p>But, a person (for example) has at least two names - a <em>first</em> and a <em>second</em> name. It is useful to organise a telephone directory by <em>surname</em> then <em>first name</em>.</p>

</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Note that row names have been reset.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>data.tables</em> never uses row names. Since <em>data.tables</em> <strong>inherit</strong> from <em>data.frames</em>, it still has the row names attribute. But it never uses them. Weâ€™ll see in a moment as to why.</p>
<p>If you would like to preserve the row names, use <code>keep.rownames = TRUE</code> in <code>as.data.table()</code> - this will create a new column called <code>rn</code> and assign row names to this column.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead, in <em>data.tables</em> we set and use <code>keys</code>. Think of a <code>key</code> as <strong>supercharged rownames</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="key-properties">Keys and their properties</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We can set keys on <em>multiple columns</em> and the column can be of <em>different types</em> â€“ <em>integer</em>, <em>numeric</em>, <em>character</em>, <em>factor</em>, <em>integer64</em> etc. <em>list</em> and <em>complex</em> types are not supported yet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uniqueness is not enforced, i.e., duplicate key values are allowed. Since rows are sorted by key, any duplicates in the key columns will appear consecutively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Setting a <code>key</code> does <em>two</em> things:</p>
<p>a. physically reorders the rows of the <em>data.table</em> by the column(s) provided <em>by reference</em>, always in <em>increasing</em> order.</p>
<p>b. marks those columns as <em>key</em> columns by setting an attribute called <code>sorted</code> to the <em>data.table</em>.</p>
<p>Since the rows are reordered, a <em>data.table</em> can have at most one key because it can not be sorted in more than one way.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For the rest of the vignette, we will work with <code>flights</code> data set.</p>

## alternatively we can provide character vectors to the function 'setkeyv()'
# setkeyv(flights, &quot;origin&quot;) # useful to program with
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can use the function <code>setkey()</code> and provide the column names (without quoting them). This is helpful during interactive use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alternatively you can pass a character vector of column names to the function <code>setkeyv()</code>. This is particularly useful while designing functions to pass columns to set key on as function arguments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Note that we did not have to assign the result back to a variable. This is because like the <code>:=</code> function we saw in the <em>â€œReference semanticsâ€</em> vignette, <code>setkey()</code> and <code>setkeyv()</code> modify the input <em>data.table</em> <em>by reference</em>. They return the result invisibly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <em>data.table</em> is now reordered (or sorted) by the column we provided - <code>origin</code>. Since we reorder by reference, we only require additional memory of one column of length equal to the number of rows in the <em>data.table</em>, and is therefore very memory efficient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can also set keys directly when creating <em>data.tables</em> using the <code>data.table()</code> function using <code>key</code> argument. It takes a character vector of column names.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="set-and">set* and <code>:=</code>:</h4>
<p>In <em>data.table</em>, the <code>:=</code> operator and all the <code>set*</code> (e.g., <code>setkey</code>, <code>setorder</code>, <code>setnames</code> etc.) functions are the only ones which modify the input object <em>by reference</em>.</p>
<p>Once you <em>key</em> a <em>data.table</em> by certain columns, you can subset by querying those key columns using the <code>.()</code> notation in <code>i</code>. Recall that <code>.()</code> is an <em>alias to</em> <code>list()</code>.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The <em>key</em> column has already been set to <code>origin</code>. So it is sufficient to provide the value, here <em>â€œJFKâ€</em>, directly. The <code>.()</code> syntax helps identify that the task requires looking up the value <em>â€œJFKâ€</em> in the key column of <em>data.table</em> (here column <code>origin</code> of <code>flights</code> <em>data.table</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <em>row indices</em> corresponding to the value <em>â€œJFKâ€</em> in <code>origin</code> is obtained first. And since there is no expression in <code>j</code>, all columns corresponding to those row indices are returned.</p>

<p>We have seen this example already in the <em>Reference semantics</em> vignette. Letâ€™s take a look at all the <code>hours</code> available in the <code>flights</code> <em>data.table</em>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-r"># get all 'hours' in flights

</code></pre>
<p>We see that there are totally <code>25</code> unique values in the data. Both <em>0</em> and <em>24</em> hours seem to be present. Letâ€™s go ahead and replace <em>24</em> with <em>0</em>, but this time using <em>key</em>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">setkey(flights, hour)
key(flights)
# [1] &quot;hour&quot;
flights[.(24), hour := 0L]
key(flights)
# NULL
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We first set <code>key</code> to <code>hour</code>. This reorders <code>flights</code> by the column <code>hour</code> and marks that column as the <code>key</code> column.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now we can subset on <code>hour</code> by using the <code>.()</code> notation. We subset for the value <em>24</em> and obtain the corresponding <em>row indices</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And on those row indices, we replace the <code>key</code> column with the value <code>0</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since we have replaced values on the <em>key</em> column, the <em>data.table</em> <code>flights</code> isnâ€™t sorted by <code>hour</code> anymore. Therefore, the key has been automatically removed by setting to NULL.</p>

<p>One advantage very likely is shorter syntax. But even more than that, <em>binary search based subsets</em> are <strong>incredibly fast</strong>.</p>
<p>As the time goes <code>data.table</code> gets new optimization and currently the latter call is automatically optimized to use <em>binary search</em>.<br />
To use slow <em>vector scan</em> key needs to be removed.</p>

<h3 id="a-performance-of-binary-search-approach">a) Performance of binary search approach</h3>
<p>To illustrate, letâ€™s create a sample <em>data.table</em> with 20 million rows and three columns and key it by columns <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.</p>

<h3 id="b-why-does-keying-a-data-table-result-in-blazing-fast-subsets">b) Why does keying a <em>data.table</em> result in blazing fast subsets?</h3>
<p>To understand that, letâ€™s first look at what <em>vector scan approach</em> (method 1) does.</p>
<h4 id="vector-scan-approach">Vector scan approach</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The column <code>x</code> is searched for the value <em>â€œgâ€</em> row by row, on all 20 million of them. This results in a <em>logical vector</em> of size 20 million, with values <code>TRUE, FALSE or NA</code> corresponding to <code>x</code>â€™s value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similarly, the column <code>y</code> is searched for <code>877</code> on all 20 million rows one by one, and stored in another logical vector.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Element wise <code>&amp;</code> operations are performed on the intermediate logical vectors and all the rows where the expression evaluates to <code>TRUE</code> are returned.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is what we call a <em>vector scan approach</em>. And this is quite inefficient, especially on larger tables and when one needs repeated subsetting, because it has to scan through all the rows each time.</p>
<p>Now let us look at binary search approach (method 2). Recall from <a href="#key-properties">Properties of key</a> - <em>setting keys reorders the data.table by key columns</em>. Since the data is sorted, we donâ€™t have to <em>scan through the entire length of the column</em>! We can instead use <em>binary search</em> to search a value in <code>O(log n)</code> as opposed to <code>O(n)</code> in case of <em>vector scan approach</em>, where <code>n</code> is the number of rows in the <em>data.table</em>.</p>
<h4 id="binary-search-approach">Binary search approach</h4>
<p>Hereâ€™s a very simple illustration. Letâ€™s consider the (sorted) numbers shown below:</p>
<pre><code>1, 5, 10, 19, 22, 23, 30
</code></pre>
<p>Suppose weâ€™d like to find the matching position of the value <em>1</em>, using binary search, this is how we would proceed - because we know that the data is <em>sorted</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Start with the middle value = 19. Is 1 == 19? No. 1 &lt; 19.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since the value weâ€™re looking for is smaller than 19, it should be somewhere before 19. So we can discard the rest of the half that are &gt;= 19.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our set is now reduced to <em>1, 5, 10</em>. Grab the middle value once again = 5. Is 1 == 5? No. 1 &lt; 5.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our set is reduced to <em>1</em>. Is 1 == 1? Yes. The corresponding index is also 1. And thatâ€™s the only match.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A vector scan approach on the other hand would have to scan through all the values (here, 7).</p>
<p>It can be seen that with every search we reduce the number of searches by half. This is why <em>binary search</em> based subsets are <strong>incredibly fast</strong>. Since rows of each column of <em>data.tables</em> have contiguous locations in memory, the operations are performed in a very cache efficient manner (also contributes to <em>speed</em>).</p>
<p>In addition, since we obtain the matching row indices directly without having to create those huge logical vectors (equal to the number of rows in a <em>data.table</em>), it is quite <strong>memory efficient</strong> as well.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>In this vignette, we have learnt another method to subset rows in <code>i</code> by keying a <em>data.table</em>. Setting keys allows us to perform blazing fast subsets by using <em>binary search</em>. In particular, we have seen how to</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>set key and subset using the key on a <em>data.table</em>.</p>

<li>
<p>subset using keys which fetches <em>row indices</em> in <code>i</code>, but much faster.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>combine key based subsets with <code>j</code> and <code>by</code>. Note that the <code>j</code> and <code>by</code> operations are exactly the same as before.</p>

<p>Key based subsets are <strong>incredibly fast</strong> and are particularly useful when the task involves <em>repeated subsetting</em>.

## Introduction

`data.table`, from its very first releases, enabled the usage of `subset` and `with` (or `within`) functions by defining the `[.data.table` method. `subset` and `with` are base R functions that are useful for reducing repetition in code, enhancing readability, and reducing number the total characters the user has to type. This functionality is possible in R because of a quite unique feature called *lazy evaluation*. This feature allows a function to catch its arguments, before they are evaluated, and to evaluate them in a different scope than the one in which they were called. Let's recap usage of the `subset` function.

```{r df_print, echo=FALSE}
registerS3method("print", "data.frame", function(x, ...) {
  base::print.data.frame(head(x, 2L), ...)
  cat("...\n")
  invisible(x)
})
.opts = options(
  datatable.print.topn=2L,
  datatable.print.nrows=20L
)
```

```{r subset}
subset(iris, Species == "setosa")
```

Here, `subset` takes the second argument and evaluates it within the scope of the `data.frame` given as its first argument. This removes the need for variable repetition, making it less prone to errors, and makes the code more readable.

## Problem description

The problem with this kind of interface is that we cannot easily parameterize the code that uses it. This is because the expressions passed to those functions are substituted before being evaluated.

### Example

```{r subset_error, error=TRUE, purl=FALSE}
my_subset = function(data, col, val) {
  subset(data, col == val)
}
my_subset(iris, Species, "setosa")
```

### Approaches to the problem

There are multiple ways to work around this problem.

#### Avoid *lazy evaluation*

The easiest workaround is to avoid *lazy evaluation* in the first place, and fall back to less intuitive, more error-prone approaches like `df[["variable"]]`, etc. 

```{r subset_nolazy}
my_subset = function(data, col, val) {
  data[data[[col]] == val & !is.na(data[[col]]), ]
}
my_subset(iris, col = "Species", val = "setosa")
```

Here, we compute a logical vector of length `nrow(iris)`, then this vector is supplied to the `i` argument of `[.data.frame` to perform ordinary "logical vector"-based subsetting. To align with `subset()`, which also drops NAs, we need to include an additional use of `data[[col]]` to catch that. It works well enough for this simple example, but it lacks flexibility, introduces variable repetition, and requires user to change the function interface to pass the column name as a character rather than unquoted symbol. The more complex the expression we need to parameterize, the less practical this approach becomes.

#### Use of `parse` / `eval`

This method is usually preferred by newcomers to R as it is, perhaps, the most straightforward conceptually. This way requires producing the required expression using string concatenation, parsing it, and then evaluating it.

```{r subset_parse}
my_subset = function(data, col, val) {
  data = deparse(substitute(data))
  col  = deparse(substitute(col))
  val  = paste0("'", val, "'")
  text = paste0("subset(", data, ", ", col, " == ", val, ")")
  eval(parse(text = text)[[1L]])
}
my_subset(iris, Species, "setosa")
```

We have to use `deparse(substitute(...))` to catch the actual names of objects passed to function, so we can construct the `subset` function call using those original names. Although this provides unlimited flexibility with relatively low complexity, **use of `eval(parse(...))` should be avoided**. The main reasons are:

- lack of syntax validation
- [vulnerability to code injection](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/2655#issuecomment-376781159)
- the existence of better alternatives

Martin Machler, R Project Core Developer, [once said](https://stackoverflow.com/a/40164111/2490497):

> Sorry but I don't understand why too many people even think a string was something that could be evaluated. You must change your mindset, really. Forget all connections between strings on one side and expressions, calls, evaluation on the other side.
The (possibly) only connection is via `parse(text = ....)` and all good R programmers should know that this is rarely an efficient or safe means to construct expressions (or calls). Rather learn more about `substitute()`, `quote()`, and possibly the power of using `do.call(substitute, ......)`.

#### Computing on the language

The aforementioned functions, along with some others (including `as.call`, `as.name`/`as.symbol`, `bquote`, and `eval`), can be categorized as functions to *compute on the language*, as they operate on _language_ objects (e.g. `call`, `name`/`symbol`).

```{r subset_substitute}
my_subset = function(data, col, val) {
  eval(substitute(subset(data, col == val)))
}
my_subset(iris, Species, "setosa")
```

Here, we used the base R `substitute` function to transform the call `subset(data, col == val)` into `subset(iris, Species == "setosa")` by substituting `data`, `col`, and `val` with their original names (or values) from their parent environment. The benefits of this approach to the previous ones should be clear. Note that because we operate at the level of language objects, and don't have to resort to string manipulation, we refer to this as *computing on the language*. There is a dedicated chapter on *Computing on the language* in [R language manual](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-lang.html). Although it is not necessary for *programming on data.table*, we encourage readers to read this chapter for the sake of better understanding this powerful and unique feature of R language.

#### Use third party packages

There are third party packages that can achieve what base R computing on the language routines do (`pryr`, `lazyeval` and `rlang`, to name a few).

Though these can be helpful, we will be discussing a `data.table`-unique approach here.

## Programming on data.table

Now that we've established the proper way to parameterize code that uses *lazy evaluation*, we can move on to the main subject of this vignette, *programming on data.table*.

Starting from version 1.15.0, data.table provides a robust mechanism for parameterizing expressions passed to the `i`, `j`, and `by` (or `keyby`) arguments of `[.data.table`. It is built upon the base R `substitute` function, and mimics its interface. Here, we introduce `substitute2` as a more robust and more user-friendly version of base R's `substitute`. For a complete list of differences between `base::substitute` and `data.table::substitute2` please read the [`substitute2` manual](https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/library/data.table/html/substitute2.html).

### Substituting variables and names

Let's say we want to have a general function that applies a function to sum of two arguments that has been applied another function. As a concrete example, below we have a function to compute the length of the hypotenuse in a right triangle, knowing length of its legs.

${\displaystyle c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}$

```{r hypotenuse}
square = function(x) x^2
quote(
  sqrt(square(a) + square(b))
)
```

The goal is the make every name in the above call able to be passed as a parameter.

```{r hypotenuse_substitute2}
substitute2(
  outer(inner(var1) + inner(var2)),
  env = list(
    outer = "sqrt",
    inner = "square",
    var1 = "a",
    var2 = "b"
  )
)
```

We can see in the output that both the functions names, as well as the names of the variables passed to those functions, have been replaced. We used `substitute2` for convenience. In this simple case, base R's `substitute` could have been used as well, though it would've required usage of `lapply(env, as.name)`.

Now, to use substitution inside `[.data.table`, we don't need to call the `substitute2` function. As it is now being used internally, all we have to do is to provide `env` argument, the same way as we've provided it to the `substitute2` function in the example above. Substitution can be applied to the `i`, `j` and `by` (or `keyby`) arguments of the `[.data.table` method. Note that setting the `verbose` argument to `TRUE` can be used to print expressions after substitution is applied. This is very useful for debugging.

Let's use the `iris` data set as a demonstration. Just as an example, let's pretend we want to compute the `Sepal.Hypotenuse`, treating the sepal width and length as if they were legs of a right triangle.

```{r hypotenuse_datatable}
DT = as.data.table(iris)

str(
  DT[, outer(inner(var1) + inner(var2)),
     env = list(
       outer = "sqrt",
       inner = "square",
       var1 = "Sepal.Length",
       var2 = "Sepal.Width"
    )]
)

# return as a data.table
DT[, .(Species, var1, var2, out = outer(inner(var1) + inner(var2))),
   env = list(
     outer = "sqrt",
     inner = "square",
     var1 = "Sepal.Length",
     var2 = "Sepal.Width",
     out = "Sepal.Hypotenuse"
  )]
```

In the last call, we added another parameter, `out = "Sepal.Hypotenuse"`, that conveys the intended name of output column. Unlike base R's `substitute`, `substitute2` will handle the substitution of the names of call arguments, as well.

Substitution works on `i` and `by` (or `keyby`), as well.

```{r hypotenuse_datatable_i_j_by}
DT[filter_col %in% filter_val,
   .(var1, var2, out = outer(inner(var1) + inner(var2))),
   by = by_col,
   env = list(
     outer = "sqrt",
     inner = "square",
     var1 = "Sepal.Length",
     var2 = "Sepal.Width",
     out = "Sepal.Hypotenuse",
     filter_col = "Species",
     filter_val = I(c("versicolor", "virginica")),
     by_col =  "Species"
  )]
```

### Substitute variables and character values

In the above example, we have seen a convenient feature of `substitute2`: automatic conversion from strings into names/symbols. An obvious question arises: what if we actually want to substitute a parameter with a *character* value, so as to have base R `substitute` behaviour. We provide a mechanism to escape automatic conversion by wrapping the elements into base R `I()` call. The `I` function marks an object as *AsIs*, preventing its arguments from character-to-symbol automatic conversion. (Read the `?AsIs` documentation for more details.) If base R behaviour is desired for the whole `env` argument, then it's best to wrap the whole argument in `I()`. Alternatively, each list element can be wrapped in `I()` individually. Let's explore both cases below.

```{r rank}
substitute(    # base R behaviour
  rank(input, ties.method = ties),
  env = list(input = as.name("Sepal.Width"), ties = "first")
)

substitute2(   # mimicking base R's "substitute" using "I"
  rank(input, ties.method = ties),
  env = I(list(input = as.name("Sepal.Width"), ties = "first"))
)

substitute2(   # only particular elements of env are used "AsIs"
  rank(input, ties.method = ties),
  env = list(input = "Sepal.Width", ties = I("first"))
)
```

Note that conversion works recursively on each list element, including the escape mechanism of course.

```{r substitute2_recursive}
substitute2(   # all are symbols
  f(v1, v2),
  list(v1 = "a", v2 = list("b", list("c", "d")))
)
substitute2(   # 'a' and 'd' should stay as character
  f(v1, v2),
  list(v1 = I("a"), v2 = list("b", list("c", I("d"))))
)
```

### Substituting lists of arbitrary length

The example presented above illustrates a neat and powerful way to make your code more dynamic. However, there are many other much more complex cases that a developer might have to deal with. One common problem handling a list of arguments of arbitrary length.

An obvious use case could be to mimic `.SD` functionality by injecting a `list` call into the `j` argument.

```{r splice_sd}
cols = c("Sepal.Length", "Sepal.Width")
DT[, .SD, .SDcols = cols]
```

Having `cols` parameter, we'd want to splice it into a `list` call, making `j` argument look like in the code below.

```{r splice_tobe}
DT[, list(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)]
```

*Splicing* is an operation where a list of objects have to be inlined into an expression as a sequence of arguments to call.
In base R, splicing `cols` into a `list` can be achieved using `as.call(c(quote(list), lapply(cols, as.name)))`. Additionally, starting from R 4.0.0, there is new interface for such an operation in the `bquote` function.

In data.table, we make it easier by automatically _enlist_-ing a list of objects into a list call with those objects. This means that any `list` object inside the `env` list argument will be turned into list `call`, making the API for that use case as simple as presented below.

```{r splice_datatable}
# this works
DT[, j,
   env = list(j = as.list(cols)),
   verbose = TRUE]

# this will not work
#DT[, list(cols),
#   env = list(cols = cols)]
```

It is important to provide a call to `as.list`, rather than simply a list, inside the `env` list argument, as is shown in the above example.

Let's explore _enlist_-ing in more detail.

```{r splice_enlist}
DT[, j,  # data.table automatically enlists nested lists into list calls
   env = list(j = as.list(cols)),
   verbose = TRUE]

DT[, j,  # turning the above 'j' list into a list call
   env = list(j = quote(list(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width))),
   verbose = TRUE]

DT[, j,  # the same as above but accepts character vector
   env = list(j = as.call(c(quote(list), lapply(cols, as.name)))),
   verbose = TRUE]
```

Now let's try to pass a list of symbols, rather than list call to those symbols. We'll use `I()` to escape automatic _enlist_-ing but, as this will also turn off character to symbol conversion, we also have to use `as.name`.

```{r splice_not, error=TRUE, purl=FALSE}
DT[, j,  # list of symbols
   env = I(list(j = lapply(cols, as.name))),
   verbose = TRUE]

DT[, j,  # again the proper way, enlist list to list call automatically
   env = list(j = as.list(cols)),
   verbose = TRUE]
```

Note that both expressions, although visually appearing to be the same, are not identical.

```{r splice_substitute2_not}
str(substitute2(j, env = I(list(j = lapply(cols, as.name)))))

str(substitute2(j, env = list(j = as.list(cols))))
```

For more detailed explanation on that matter, please see the examples in the [`substitute2` documentation](https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/library/data.table/html/substitute2.html).

### Substitution of a complex query

Let's take, as an example of a more complex function, calculating root mean square.

${\displaystyle x_{\text{RMS}}={\sqrt{{\frac{1}{n}}\left(x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+\cdots +x_{n}^{2}\right)}}}$

It takes arbitrary number of variables on input, but now we cannot just *splice* a list of arguments into a list call because each of those arguments have to be wrapped in a `square` call. In this case, we have to *splice* by hand rather than relying on data.table's automatic _enlist_.

First, we have to construct calls to the `square` function for each of the variables (see `inner_calls`). Then, we have to reduce the list of calls into a single call, having a nested sequence of `+` calls (see `add_calls`). Lastly, we have to substitute the constructed call into the surrounding expression (see `rms`).

```{r complex}
outer = "sqrt"
inner = "square"
vars = c("Sepal.Length", "Sepal.Width", "Petal.Length", "Petal.Width")

syms = lapply(vars, as.name)
to_inner_call = function(var, fun) call(fun, var)
inner_calls = lapply(syms, to_inner_call, inner)
print(inner_calls)

to_add_call = function(x, y) call("+", x, y)
add_calls = Reduce(to_add_call, inner_calls)
print(add_calls)

rms = substitute2(
  expr = outer((add_calls) / len),
  env = list(
    outer = outer,
    add_calls = add_calls,
    len = length(vars)
  )
)
print(rms)

str(
  DT[, j, env = list(j = rms)]
)

# same, but skipping last substitute2 call and using add_calls directly
str(
  DT[, outer((add_calls) / len),
     env = list(
       outer = outer,
       add_calls = add_calls,
       len = length(vars)
    )]
)

# return as data.table
j = substitute2(j, list(j = as.list(setNames(nm = c(vars, "Species", "rms")))))
j[["rms"]] = rms
print(j)
DT[, j, env = list(j = j)]

# alternatively
j = as.call(c(
  quote(list),
  lapply(setNames(nm = vars), as.name),
  list(Species = as.name("Species")),
  list(rms = rms)
))
print(j)
DT[, j, env = list(j = j)]
```

## Retired interfaces

In `[.data.table`, it is also possible to use other mechanisms for variable substitution or for passing quoted expressions. These include `get` and `mget` for inline injection of variables by providing their names as strings, and `eval` that tells `[.data.table` that the expression we passed into an argument is a quoted expression and that it should be handled differently. Those interfaces should now be considered retired and we recommend using the new `env` argument, instead.

### `get`

```{r old_get}
v1 = "Petal.Width"
v2 = "Sepal.Width"

DT[, .(total = sum(get(v1), get(v2)))]

DT[, .(total = sum(v1, v2)),
   env = list(v1 = v1, v2 = v2)]
```

### `mget`

```{r old_mget}
v = c("Petal.Width", "Sepal.Width")

DT[, lapply(mget(v), mean)]

DT[, lapply(v, mean),
   env = list(v = as.list(v))]

DT[, lapply(v, mean),
   env = list(v = as.list(setNames(nm = v)))]
```

### `eval`

Instead of using `eval` function we can provide quoted expression into the element of `env` argument, no extra `eval` call is needed then.

```{r old_eval}
cl = quote(
  .(Petal.Width = mean(Petal.Width), Sepal.Width = mean(Sepal.Width))
)

DT[, eval(cl)]

DT[, cl, env = list(cl = cl)]
```

```{r cleanup, echo=FALSE}
options(.opts)
registerS3method("print", "data.frame", base::print.data.frame)
```

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><code>data.table</code>, from its very first releases, enabled the usage of <code>subset</code> and <code>with</code> (or <code>within</code>) functions by defining the <code>[.data.table</code> method. <code>subset</code> and <code>with</code> are base R functions that are useful for reducing repetition in code, enhancing readability, and reducing number the total characters the user has to type. This functionality is possible in R because of a quite unique feature called <em>lazy evaluation</em>. This feature allows a function to catch its arguments, before they are evaluated, and to evaluate them in a different scope than the one in which they were called. Letâ€™s recap usage of the <code>subset</code> function.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">subset(iris, Species == &quot;setosa&quot;)
#   Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species
# 1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa
# 2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa
# ...
</code></pre>
<p>Here, <code>subset</code> takes the second argument and evaluates it within the scope of the <code>data.frame</code> given as its first argument. This removes the need for variable repetition, making it less prone to errors, and makes the code more readable.</p>
<h2 id="problem-description">Problem description</h2>
<p>The problem with this kind of interface is that we cannot easily parameterize the code that uses it. This is because the expressions passed to those functions are substituted before being evaluated.</p>
<h3 id="example">Example</h3>
<pre><code class="language-r">my_subset = function(data, col, val) {
  subset(data, col == val)
}
my_subset(iris, Species, &quot;setosa&quot;)
# Error: object 'Species' not found
</code></pre>
<h3 id="approaches-to-the-problem">Approaches to the problem</h3>
<p>There are multiple ways to work around this problem.</p>
<h4 id="avoid-lazy-evaluation">Avoid <em>lazy evaluation</em></h4>
<p>The easiest workaround is to avoid <em>lazy evaluation</em> in the first place, and fall back to less intuitive, more error-prone approaches like <code>df[[&quot;variable&quot;]]</code>, etc.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">my_subset = function(data, col, val) {
  data[data[[col]] == val &amp; !is.na(data[[col]]), ]
}
my_subset(iris, col = &quot;Species&quot;, val = &quot;setosa&quot;)
#   Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species
# 1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa
# 2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa
# ...
</code></pre>
<p>Here, we compute a logical vector of length <code>nrow(iris)</code>, then this vector is supplied to the <code>i</code> argument of <code>[.data.frame</code> to perform ordinary â€œlogical vectorâ€-based subsetting. To align with <code>subset()</code>, which also drops NAs, we need to include an additional use of <code>data[[col]]</code> to catch that. It works well enough for this simple example, but it lacks flexibility, introduces variable repetition, and requires user to change the function interface to pass the column name as a character rather than unquoted symbol. The more complex the expression we need to parameterize, the less practical this approach becomes.</p>
<h4 id="use-of-parse-eval">Use of <code>parse</code> / <code>eval</code></h4>
<p>This method is usually preferred by newcomers to R as it is, perhaps, the most straightforward conceptually. This way requires producing the required expression using string concatenation, parsing it, and then evaluating it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">my_subset = function(data, col, val) {
  data = deparse(substitute(data))
  col  = deparse(substitute(col))
  val  = paste0(&quot;'&quot;, val, &quot;'&quot;)
  text = paste0(&quot;subset(&quot;, data, &quot;, &quot;, col, &quot; == &quot;, val, &quot;)&quot;)
  eval(parse(text = text)[[1L]])
}
my_subset(iris, Species, &quot;setosa&quot;)
#   Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species
# 1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa
# 2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa
# ...
</code></pre>
<p>We have to use <code>deparse(substitute(...))</code> to catch the actual names of objects passed to function, so we can construct the <code>subset</code> function call using those original names. Although this provides unlimited flexibility with relatively low complexity, <strong>use of <code>eval(parse(...))</code> should be avoided</strong>. The main reasons are:</p>
<ul>
<li>lack of syntax validation</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/2655#issuecomment-376781159">vulnerability to code injection</a></li>
<li>the existence of better alternatives</li>
</ul>
<p>Martin Machler, R Project Core Developer, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/40164111/2490497">once said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sorry but I donâ€™t understand why too many people even think a string was something that could be evaluated. You must change your mindset, really. Forget all connections between strings on one side and expressions, calls, evaluation on the other side.
The (possibly) only connection is via <code>parse(text = ....)</code> and all good R programmers should know that this is rarely an efficient or safe means to construct expressions (or calls). Rather learn more about <code>substitute()</code>, <code>quote()</code>, and possibly the power of using <code>do.call(substitute, ......)</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="computing-on-the-language">Computing on the language</h4>
<p>The aforementioned functions, along with some others (including <code>as.call</code>, <code>as.name</code>/<code>as.symbol</code>, <code>bquote</code>, and <code>eval</code>), can be categorized as functions to <em>compute on the language</em>, as they operate on <em>language</em> objects (e.g. <code>call</code>, <code>name</code>/<code>symbol</code>).</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">my_subset = function(data, col, val) {
  eval(substitute(subset(data, col == val)))
}
my_subset(iris, Species, &quot;setosa&quot;)
#   Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species
# 1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa
# 2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa
# ...
</code></pre>
<p>Here, we used the base R <code>substitute</code> function to transform the call <code>subset(data, col == val)</code> into <code>subset(iris, Species == &quot;setosa&quot;)</code> by substituting <code>data</code>, <code>col</code>, and <code>val</code> with their original names (or values) from their parent environment. The benefits of this approach to the previous ones should be clear. Note that because we operate at the level of language objects, and donâ€™t have to resort to string manipulation, we refer to this as <em>computing on the language</em>. There is a dedicated chapter on <em>Computing on the language</em> in <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-lang.html">R language manual</a>. Although it is not necessary for <em>programming on data.table</em>, we encourage readers to read this chapter for the sake of better understanding this powerful and unique feature of R language.</p>
<h4 id="use-third-party-packages">Use third party packages</h4>
<p>There are third party packages that can achieve what base R computing on the language routines do (<code>pryr</code>, <code>lazyeval</code> and <code>rlang</code>, to name a few).</p>
<p>Though these can be helpful, we will be discussing a <code>data.table</code>-unique approach here.</p>
<h2 id="programming-on-data-table">Programming on data.table</h2>
<p>Now that weâ€™ve established the proper way to parameterize code that uses <em>lazy evaluation</em>, we can move on to the main subject of this vignette, <em>programming on data.table</em>.</p>
<p>Starting from version 1.15.0, data.table provides a robust mechanism for parameterizing expressions passed to the <code>i</code>, <code>j</code>, and <code>by</code> (or <code>keyby</code>) arguments of <code>[.data.table</code>. It is built upon the base R <code>substitute</code> function, and mimics its interface. Here, we introduce <code>substitute2</code> as a more robust and more user-friendly version of base Râ€™s <code>substitute</code>. For a complete list of differences between <code>base::substitute</code> and <code>data.table::substitute2</code> please read the <a href="https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/library/data.table/html/substitute2.html"><code>substitute2</code> manual</a>.</p>
<h3 id="substituting-variables-and-names">Substituting variables and names</h3>
<p>Letâ€™s say we want to have a general function that applies a function to sum of two arguments that has been applied another function. As a concrete example, below we have a function to compute the length of the hypotenuse in a right triangle, knowing length of its legs.</p>
<p>\({\displaystyle c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}\)</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">square = function(x) x^2
quote(
  sqrt(square(a) + square(b))
)
# sqrt(square(a) + square(b))
</code></pre>
<p>The goal is the make every name in the above call able to be passed as a parameter.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">substitute2(
  outer(inner(var1) + inner(var2)),
  env = list(
    outer = &quot;sqrt&quot;,
    inner = &quot;square&quot;,
    var1 = &quot;a&quot;,
    var2 = &quot;b&quot;
  )
)
# sqrt(square(a) + square(b))
</code></pre>
<p>We can see in the output that both the functions names, as well as the names of the variables passed to those functions, have been replaced. We used <code>substitute2</code> for convenience. In this simple case, base Râ€™s <code>substitute</code> could have been used as well, though it wouldâ€™ve required usage of <code>lapply(env, as.name)</code>.</p>
<p>Now, to use substitution inside <code>[.data.table</code>, we donâ€™t need to call the <code>substitute2</code> function. As it is now being used internally, all we have to do is to provide <code>env</code> argument, the same way as weâ€™ve provided it to the <code>substitute2</code> function in the example above. Substitution can be applied to the <code>i</code>, <code>j</code> and <code>by</code> (or <code>keyby</code>) arguments of the <code>[.data.table</code> method. Note that setting the <code>verbose</code> argument to <code>TRUE</code> can be used to print expressions after substitution is applied. This is very useful for debugging.</p>
<p>Letâ€™s use the <code>iris</code> data set as a demonstration. Just as an example, letâ€™s pretend we want to compute the <code>Sepal.Hypotenuse</code>, treating the sepal width and length as if they were legs of a right triangle.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">DT = as.data.table(iris)

str(
  DT[, outer(inner(var1) + inner(var2)),
     env = list(
       outer = &quot;sqrt&quot;,
       inner = &quot;square&quot;,
       var1 = &quot;Sepal.Length&quot;,
       var2 = &quot;Sepal.Width&quot;
    )]
)
#  num [1:150] 6.19 5.75 5.69 5.55 6.16 ...

# return as a data.table
DT[, .(Species, var1, var2, out = outer(inner(var1) + inner(var2))),
   env = list(
     outer = &quot;sqrt&quot;,
     inner = &quot;square&quot;,
     var1 = &quot;Sepal.Length&quot;,
     var2 = &quot;Sepal.Width&quot;,
     out = &quot;Sepal.Hypotenuse&quot;
  )]
#        Species Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Sepal.Hypotenuse
#         &lt;fctr&gt;        &lt;num&gt;       &lt;num&gt;            &lt;num&gt;
#   1:    setosa          5.1         3.5         6.185467
#   2:    setosa          4.9         3.0         5.745433
#  ---

</code></pre>
<p>In the last call, we added another parameter, <code>out = &quot;Sepal.Hypotenuse&quot;</code>, that conveys the intended name of output column. Unlike base Râ€™s <code>substitute</code>, <code>substitute2</code> will handle the substitution of the names of call arguments, as well.</p>
<p>Substitution works on <code>i</code> and <code>by</code> (or <code>keyby</code>), as well.</p>

<h3 id="substitute-variables-and-character-values">Substitute variables and character values</h3>
<p>In the above example, we have seen a convenient feature of <code>substitute2</code>: automatic conversion from strings into names/symbols. An obvious question arises: what if we actually want to substitute a parameter with a <em>character</em> value, so as to have base R <code>substitute</code> behaviour. We provide a mechanism to escape automatic conversion by wrapping the elements into base R <code>I()</code> call. The <code>I</code> function marks an object as <em>AsIs</em>, preventing its arguments from character-to-symbol automatic conversion. (Read the <code>?AsIs</code> documentation for more details.) If base R behaviour is desired for the whole <code>env</code> argument, then itâ€™s best to wrap the whole argument in <code>I()</code>. Alternatively, each list element can be wrapped in <code>I()</code> individually. Letâ€™s explore both cases below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">substitute(    # base R behaviour
  rank(input, ties.method = ties),
  env = list(input = as.name(&quot;Sepal.Width&quot;), ties = &quot;first&quot;)
)
# rank(Sepal.Width, ties.method = &quot;first&quot;)

substitute2(   # mimicking base R's &quot;substitute&quot; using &quot;I&quot;
  rank(input, ties.method = ties),
  env = I(list(input = as.name(&quot;Sepal.Width&quot;), ties = &quot;first&quot;))
)
# rank(Sepal.Width, ties.method = &quot;first&quot;)

substitute2(   # only particular elements of env are used &quot;AsIs&quot;
  rank(input, ties.method = ties),
  env = list(input = &quot;Sepal.Width&quot;, ties = I(&quot;first&quot;))
)
# rank(Sepal.Width, ties.method = &quot;first&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>Note that conversion works recursively on each list element, including the escape mechanism of course.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">substitute2(   # all are symbols
  f(v1, v2),
  list(v1 = &quot;a&quot;, v2 = list(&quot;b&quot;, list(&quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;)))
)
# f(a, list(b, list(c, d)))
substitute2(   # 'a' and 'd' should stay as character
  f(v1, v2),
  list(v1 = I(&quot;a&quot;), v2 = list(&quot;b&quot;, list(&quot;c&quot;, I(&quot;d&quot;))))
)
# f(&quot;a&quot;, list(b, list(c, &quot;d&quot;)))
</code></pre>
<h3 id="substituting-lists-of-arbitrary-length">Substituting lists of arbitrary length</h3>
<p>The example presented above illustrates a neat and powerful way to make your code more dynamic. However, there are many other much more complex cases that a developer might have to deal with. One common problem handling a list of arguments of arbitrary length.</p>
<p>An obvious use case could be to mimic <code>.SD</code> functionality by injecting a <code>list</code> call into the <code>j</code> argument.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">cols = c(&quot;Sepal.Length&quot;, &quot;Sepal.Width&quot;)
DT[, .SD, .SDcols = cols]
#      Sepal.Length Sepal.Width
#             &lt;num&gt;       &lt;num&gt;
#   1:          5.1         3.5
#   2:          4.9         3.0
#  ---                         
# 149:          6.2         3.4
# 150:          5.9         3.0
</code></pre>
<p>Having <code>cols</code> parameter, weâ€™d want to splice it into a <code>list</code> call, making <code>j</code> argument look like in the code below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">DT[, list(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)]
#      Sepal.Length Sepal.Width
#             &lt;num&gt;       &lt;num&gt;
#   1:          5.1         3.5
#   2:          4.9         3.0
#  ---                         
# 149:          6.2         3.4
# 150:          5.9         3.0
</code></pre>
<p><em>Splicing</em> is an operation where a list of objects have to be inlined into an expression as a sequence of arguments to call.
In base R, splicing <code>cols</code> into a <code>list</code> can be achieved using <code>as.call(c(quote(list), lapply(cols, as.name)))</code>. Additionally, starting from R 4.0.0, there is new interface for such an operation in the <code>bquote</code> function.</p>
<p>In data.table, we make it easier by automatically <em>enlist</em>-ing a list of objects into a list call with those objects. This means that any <code>list</code> object inside the <code>env</code> list argument will be turned into list <code>call</code>, making the API for that use case as simple as presented below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r"># this works
DT[, j,
   env = list(j = as.list(cols)),
   verbose = TRUE]
# Argument 'j' after substitute: list(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)
# Detected that j uses these columns: [Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width]

<p>It is important to provide a call to <code>as.list</code>, rather than simply a list, inside the <code>env</code> list argument, as is shown in the above example.</p>
<p>Letâ€™s explore <em>enlist</em>-ing in more detail.</p>

<p>Now letâ€™s try to pass a list of symbols, rather than list call to those symbols. Weâ€™ll use <code>I()</code> to escape automatic <em>enlist</em>-ing but, as this will also turn off character to symbol conversion, we also have to use <code>as.name</code>.</p>

<h3 id="substitution-of-a-complex-query">Substitution of a complex query</h3>
<p>Letâ€™s take, as an example of a more complex function, calculating root mean square.</p>
<p>\({\displaystyle x_{\text{RMS}}={\sqrt{{\frac{1}{n}}\left(x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+\cdots +x_{n}^{2}\right)}}}\)</p>
<p>It takes arbitrary number of variables on input, but now we cannot just <em>splice</em> a list of arguments into a list call because each of those arguments have to be wrapped in a <code>square</code> call. In this case, we have to <em>splice</em> by hand rather than relying on data.tableâ€™s automatic <em>enlist</em>.</p>
<p>First, we have to construct calls to the <code>square</code> function for each of the variables (see <code>inner_calls</code>). Then, we have to reduce the list of calls into a single call, having a nested sequence of <code>+</code> calls (see <code>add_calls</code>). Lastly, we have to substitute the constructed call into the surrounding expression (see <code>rms</code>).</p>

This vignette discusses *data.table*'s reference semantics which allows to *add/update/delete* columns of a *data.table by reference*, and also combine them with `i` and `by`. It is aimed at those who are already familiar with *data.table* syntax, its general form, how to subset rows in `i`, select and compute on columns, and perform aggregations by group. If you're not familiar with these concepts, please read the *"Introduction to data.table"* vignette first.

***

## Data {#data}

We will use the same `flights` data as in the *"Introduction to data.table"* vignette.

```{r echo = FALSE}
options(width = 100L)
```

```{r}
flights <- fread("flights14.csv")
flights
dim(flights)
```

## Introduction

In this vignette, we will

1. first discuss reference semantics briefly and look at the two different forms in which the `:=` operator can be used

2. then see how we can *add/update/delete* columns *by reference* in `j` using the `:=` operator and how to combine with `i` and `by`.

3. and finally we will look at using `:=` for its *side-effect* and how we can avoid the side effects using `copy()`.

## 1. Reference semantics

All the operations we have seen so far in the previous vignette resulted in a new data set. We will see how to *add* new column(s), *update* or *delete* existing column(s) on the original data.

### a) Background

Before we look at *reference semantics*, consider the *data.frame* shown below:

```{r}
DF = data.frame(ID = c("b","b","b","a","a","c"), a = 1:6, b = 7:12, c = 13:18)
DF
```

When we did:

```{r eval = FALSE}
DF$c <- 18:13               # (1) -- replace entire column
# or
DF$c[DF$ID == "b"] <- 15:13 # (2) -- subassign in column 'c'
```

both (1) and (2) resulted in deep copy of the entire data.frame in versions of `R` versions `< 3.1`. [It copied more than once](https://stackoverflow.com/q/23898969/559784). To improve performance by avoiding these redundant copies, *data.table* utilised the [available but unused `:=` operator in R](https://stackoverflow.com/q/7033106/559784).

Great performance improvements were made in `R v3.1` as a result of which only a *shallow* copy is made for (1) and not *deep* copy. However, for (2) still, the entire column is *deep* copied even in `R v3.1+`. This means the more columns one subassigns to in the *same query*, the more *deep* copies R does.

#### *shallow* vs *deep* copy

A *shallow* copy is just a copy of the vector of column pointers (corresponding to the columns in a *data.frame* or *data.table*). The actual data is not physically copied in memory.

A *deep* copy on the other hand copies the entire data to another location in memory.

When subsetting a *data.table* using `i` (e.g., `DT[1:10]`), a *deep* copy is made. However, when `i` is not provided or equals `TRUE`, a *shallow* copy is made.

#
With *data.table's* `:=` operator, absolutely no copies are made in *both* (1) and (2), irrespective of R version you are using. This is because `:=` operator updates *data.table* columns *in-place* (by reference).

### b) The `:=` operator

It can be used in `j` in two ways:

(a) The `LHS := RHS` form

```{r eval = FALSE}
DT[, c("colA", "colB", ...) := list(valA, valB, ...)]

# when you have only one column to assign to you
# can drop the quotes and list(), for convenience
DT[, colA := valA]
```

(b) The functional form

```{r eval = FALSE}
DT[, `:=`(colA = valA, # valA is assigned to colA
          colB = valB, # valB is assigned to colB
          ...
)]
```

Note that the code above explains how `:=` can be used. They are not working examples. We will start using them on `flights` *data.table* from the next section.

#

* In (a), `LHS` takes a character vector of column names and `RHS` a *list of values*. `RHS` just needs to be a `list`, irrespective of how its generated (e.g., using `lapply()`, `list()`, `mget()`, `mapply()` etc.). This form is usually easy to program with and is particularly useful when you don't know the columns to assign values to in advance.

* On the other hand, (b) is handy if you would like to jot some comments down for later.

* The result is returned *invisibly*.

* Since `:=` is available in `j`, we can combine it with `i` and `by` operations just like the aggregation operations we saw in the previous vignette.

#

In the two forms of `:=` shown above, note that we don't assign the result back to a variable. Because we don't need to. The input *data.table* is modified by reference. Let's go through examples to understand what we mean by this.

For the rest of the vignette, we will work with `flights` *data.table*.

## 2. Add/update/delete columns *by reference*

### a) Add columns by reference {#ref-j}

#### -- How can we add columns *speed* and *total delay* of each flight to `flights` *data.table*?

```{r}
flights[, `:=`(speed = distance / (air_time/60), # speed in mph (mi/h)
               delay = arr_delay + dep_delay)]   # delay in minutes
head(flights)

## alternatively, using the 'LHS := RHS' form
# flights[, c("speed", "delay") := list(distance/(air_time/60), arr_delay + dep_delay)]
```

#### Note that

* We did not have to assign the result back to `flights`.

* The `flights` *data.table* now contains the two newly added columns. This is what we mean by *added by reference*.

* We used the functional form so that we could add comments on the side to explain what the computation does. You can also see the `LHS := RHS` form (commented).

### b) Update some rows of columns by reference - *sub-assign* by reference  {#ref-i-j}

Let's take a look at all the `hours` available in the `flights` *data.table*:

```{r}
# get all 'hours' in flights
flights[, sort(unique(hour))]
```

We see that there are totally `25` unique values in the data. Both *0* and *24* hours seem to be present. Let's go ahead and replace *24* with *0*.

#### -- Replace those rows where `hour == 24` with the value `0`

```{r}
# subassign by reference
flights[hour == 24L, hour := 0L]
```

* We can use `i` along with `:=` in `j` the very same way as we have already seen in the *"Introduction to data.table"* vignette.

* Column `hour` is replaced with `0` only on those *row indices* where the condition `hour == 24L` specified in `i` evaluates to `TRUE`.

* `:=` returns the result invisibly. Sometimes it might be necessary to see the result after the assignment. We can accomplish that by adding an empty `[]` at the end of the query as shown below:

    ```{r}
    flights[hour == 24L, hour := 0L][]
    ```

#
Let's look at all the `hours` to verify.

```{r}
# check again for '24'
flights[, sort(unique(hour))]
```

#### Exercise: {#update-by-reference-question}

What is the difference between `flights[hour == 24L, hour := 0L]` and `flights[hour == 24L][, hour := 0L]`? Hint: The latter needs an assignment (`<-`) if you would want to use the result later.

If you can't figure it out, have a look at the `Note` section of `?":="`.

### c) Delete column by reference

#### -- Remove `delay` column

```{r}
flights[, c("delay") := NULL]
head(flights)

## or using the functional form
# flights[, `:=`(delay = NULL)]
```

#### {#delete-convenience}

* Assigning `NULL` to a column *deletes* that column. And it happens *instantly*.

* We can also pass column numbers instead of names in the `LHS`, although it is good programming practice to use column names.

* When there is just one column to delete, we can drop the `c()` and double quotes and just use the column name *unquoted*, for convenience. That is:

    ```{r eval = FALSE}
    flights[, delay := NULL]
    ```

    is equivalent to the code above.

### d) `:=` along with grouping using `by` {#ref-j-by}

We have already seen the use of `i` along with `:=` in [Section 2b](#ref-i-j). Let's now see how we can use `:=` along with `by`.

#### -- How can we add a new column which contains for each `orig,dest` pair the maximum speed?

```{r}
flights[, max_speed := max(speed), by = .(origin, dest)]
head(flights)
```

* We add a new column `max_speed` using the `:=` operator by reference.

* We provide the columns to group by the same way as shown in the *Introduction to data.table* vignette. For each group, `max(speed)` is computed, which returns a single value. That value is recycled to fit the length of the group. Once again, no copies are being made at all. `flights` *data.table* is modified *in-place*.

* We could have also provided `by` with a *character vector* as we saw in the *Introduction to data.table* vignette, e.g., `by = c("origin", "dest")`.

#

### e) Multiple columns and `:=`

#### -- How can we add two more columns computing `max()` of `dep_delay` and `arr_delay` for each month, using `.SD`?

```{r}
in_cols  = c("dep_delay", "arr_delay")
out_cols = c("max_dep_delay", "max_arr_delay")
flights[, c(out_cols) := lapply(.SD, max), by = month, .SDcols = in_cols]
head(flights)
```

* We use the `LHS := RHS` form. We store the input column names and the new columns to add in separate variables and provide them to `.SDcols` and for `LHS` (for better readability).

* Note that since we allow assignment by reference without quoting column names when there is only one column as explained in [Section 2c](#delete-convenience), we can not do `out_cols := lapply(.SD, max)`. That would result in adding one new column named `out_col`. Instead we should do either `c(out_cols)` or simply `(out_cols)`. Wrapping the variable name with `(` is enough to differentiate between the two cases.

* The `LHS := RHS` form allows us to operate on multiple columns. In the RHS, to compute the `max` on columns specified in `.SDcols`, we make use of the base function `lapply()` along with `.SD` in the same way as we have seen before in the *"Introduction to data.table"* vignette. It returns a list of two elements, containing the maximum value corresponding to `dep_delay` and `arr_delay` for each group.

#
Before moving on to the next section, let's clean up the newly created columns `speed`, `max_speed`, `max_dep_delay` and `max_arr_delay`.

```{r}
# RHS gets automatically recycled to length of LHS
flights[, c("speed", "max_speed", "max_dep_delay", "max_arr_delay") := NULL]
head(flights)
```

#### -- How can we update multiple existing columns in place using `.SD`?

```{r}
flights[, names(.SD) := lapply(.SD, as.factor), .SDcols = is.character]
```
Let's clean up again and convert our newly-made factor columns back into character columns. This time we will make use of `.SDcols` accepting a function to decide which columns to include. In this case, `is.factor()` will return the columns which are factors. For more on the **S**ubset of the **D**ata, there is also an [SD Usage vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/package=data.table/vignettes/datatable-sd-usage.html).

Sometimes, it is also nice to keep track of columns that we transform. That way, even after we convert our columns we would be able to call the specific columns we were updating.
```{r}
factor_cols <- sapply(flights, is.factor)
flights[, names(.SD) := lapply(.SD, as.character), .SDcols = factor_cols]
str(flights[, ..factor_cols])
```

#### {.bs-callout .bs-callout-info}

* We also could have used `(factor_cols)` on the `LHS` instead of `names(.SD)`.

## 3. `:=` and `copy()`

`:=` modifies the input object by reference. Apart from the features we have discussed already, sometimes we might want to use the update by reference feature for its side effect. And at other times it may not be desirable to modify the original object, in which case we can use `copy()` function, as we will see in a moment.

### a) `:=` for its side effect

Let's say we would like to create a function that would return the *maximum speed* for each month. But at the same time, we would also like to add the column `speed` to *flights*. We could write a simple function as follows:

```{r}
foo <- function(DT) {
  DT[, speed := distance / (air_time/60)]
  DT[, .(max_speed = max(speed)), by = month]
}
ans = foo(flights)
head(flights)
head(ans)
```

* Note that the new column `speed` has been added to `flights` *data.table*. This is because `:=` performs operations by reference. Since `DT` (the function argument) and `flights` refer to the same object in memory, modifying `DT` also reflects on `flights`.

* And `ans` contains the maximum speed for each month.

### b) The `copy()` function

In the previous section, we used `:=` for its side effect. But of course this may not be always desirable. Sometimes, we would like to pass a *data.table* object to a function, and might want to use the `:=` operator, but *wouldn't* want to update the original object. We can accomplish this using the function `copy()`.

The `copy()` function *deep* copies the input object and therefore any subsequent update by reference operations performed on the copied object will not affect the original object.

#

There are two particular places where `copy()` function is essential:

1. Contrary to the situation we have seen in the previous point, we may not want the input data.table to a function to be modified *by reference*. As an example, let's consider the task in the previous section, except we don't want to modify `flights` by reference.

    Let's first delete the `speed` column we generated in the previous section.

    ```{r}
    flights[, speed := NULL]
    ```
    Now, we could accomplish the task as follows:

    ```{r}
    foo <- function(DT) {
      DT <- copy(DT)                              ## deep copy
      DT[, speed := distance / (air_time/60)]     ## doesn't affect 'flights'
      DT[, .(max_speed = max(speed)), by = month]
    }
    ans <- foo(flights)
    head(flights)
    head(ans)
    ```

* Using `copy()` function did not update `flights` *data.table* by reference. It doesn't contain the column `speed`.

* And `ans` contains the maximum speed corresponding to each month.

However we could improve this functionality further by *shallow* copying instead of *deep* copying. In fact, we would very much like to [provide this functionality for `v1.9.8`](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/617). We will touch up on this again in the *data.table design* vignette.

#

2. When we store the column names on to a variable, e.g., `DT_n = names(DT)`, and then *add/update/delete* column(s) *by reference*. It would also modify `DT_n`, unless we do `copy(names(DT))`.

    ```{r}
    DT = data.table(x = 1L, y = 2L)
    DT_n = names(DT)
    DT_n

    ## add a new column by reference
    DT[, z := 3L]

    ## DT_n also gets updated
    DT_n

    ## use `copy()`
    DT_n = copy(names(DT))
    DT[, w := 4L]

    ## DT_n doesn't get updated
    DT_n
    ```

## Summary

#### The `:=` operator

* It is used to *add/update/delete* columns by reference.

* We have also seen how to use `:=` along with `i` and `by` the same way as we have seen in the *Introduction to data.table* vignette. We can in the same way use `keyby`, chain operations together, and pass expressions to `by` as well all in the same way. The syntax is *consistent*.

* We can use `:=` for its side effect or use `copy()` to not modify the original object while updating by reference.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
setDTthreads(.old.th)
```

#

So far we have seen a whole lot in `j`, and how to combine it with `by` and little of `i`. Let's turn our attention back to `i` in the next vignette *"Keys and fast binary search based subset"* to perform *blazing fast subsets* by *keying data.tables*.

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In this vignette, we will</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>first discuss reference semantics briefly and look at the two different forms in which the <code>:=</code> operator can be used</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>then see how we can <em>add/update/delete</em> columns <em>by reference</em> in <code>j</code> using the <code>:=</code> operator and how to combine with <code>i</code> and <code>by</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and finally we will look at using <code>:=</code> for its <em>side-effect</em> and how we can avoid the side effects using <code>copy()</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="1-reference-semantics">1. Reference semantics</h2>
<p>All the operations we have seen so far in the previous vignette resulted in a new data set. We will see how to <em>add</em> new column(s), <em>update</em> or <em>delete</em> existing column(s) on the original data.</p>
<h3 id="a-background">a) Background</h3>
<p>Before we look at <em>reference semantics</em>, consider the <em>data.frame</em> shown below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">DF = data.frame(ID = c(&quot;b&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;a&quot;,&quot;a&quot;,&quot;c&quot;), a = 1:6, b = 7:12, c = 13:18)
DF
#   ID a  b  c
# 1  b 1  7 13
# 2  b 2  8 14
# 3  b 3  9 15
# 4  a 4 10 16
# 5  a 5 11 17
# 6  c 6 12 18
</code></pre>
<p>When we did:</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">DF$c &lt;- 18:13               # (1) -- replace entire column
# or
DF$c[DF$ID == &quot;b&quot;] &lt;- 15:13 # (2) -- subassign in column 'c'
</code></pre>
<p>both (1) and (2) resulted in deep copy of the entire data.frame in versions of <code>R</code> versions <code>&lt; 3.1</code>. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/23898969/559784">It copied more than once</a>. To improve performance by avoiding these redundant copies, <em>data.table</em> utilised the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/7033106/559784">available but unused <code>:=</code> operator in R</a>.</p>
<p>Great performance improvements were made in <code>R v3.1</code> as a result of which only a <em>shallow</em> copy is made for (1) and not <em>deep</em> copy. However, for (2) still, the entire column is <em>deep</em> copied even in <code>R v3.1+</code>. This means the more columns one subassigns to in the <em>same query</em>, the more <em>deep</em> copies R does.</p>
<h4 id="shallow-vs-deep-copy"><em>shallow</em> vs <em>deep</em> copy</h4>
<p>A <em>shallow</em> copy is just a copy of the vector of column pointers (corresponding to the columns in a <em>data.frame</em> or <em>data.table</em>). The actual data is not physically copied in memory.</p>
<p>A <em>deep</em> copy on the other hand copies the entire data to another location in memory.</p>
<p>When subsetting a <em>data.table</em> using <code>i</code> (e.g., <code>DT[1:10]</code>), a <em>deep</em> copy is made. However, when <code>i</code> is not provided or equals <code>TRUE</code>, a <em>shallow</em> copy is made.</p>
<h1></h1>
<p>With <em>data.tableâ€™s</em> <code>:=</code> operator, absolutely no copies are made in <em>both</em> (1) and (2), irrespective of R version you are using. This is because <code>:=</code> operator updates <em>data.table</em> columns <em>in-place</em> (by reference).</p>
<h3 id="b-the-operator">b) The <code>:=</code> operator</h3>
<p>It can be used in <code>j</code> in two ways:</p>
<p>(a) The <code>LHS := RHS</code> form</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">DT[, c(&quot;colA&quot;, &quot;colB&quot;, ...) := list(valA, valB, ...)]

# when you have only one column to assign to you
# can drop the quotes and list(), for convenience
DT[, colA := valA]
</code></pre>
<p>(b) The functional form</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">DT[, `:=`(colA = valA, # valA is assigned to colA
          colB = valB, # valB is assigned to colB
          ...
)]
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the code above explains how <code>:=</code> can be used. They are not working examples. We will start using them on <code>flights</code> <em>data.table</em> from the next section.</p>
<h1></h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In (a), <code>LHS</code> takes a character vector of column names and <code>RHS</code> a <em>list of values</em>. <code>RHS</code> just needs to be a <code>list</code>, irrespective of how its generated (e.g., using <code>lapply()</code>, <code>list()</code>, <code>mget()</code>, <code>mapply()</code> etc.). This form is usually easy to program with and is particularly useful when you donâ€™t know the columns to assign values to in advance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the other hand, (b) is handy if you would like to jot some comments down for later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The result is returned <em>invisibly</em>.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>We use the <code>LHS := RHS</code> form. We store the input column names and the new columns to add in separate variables and provide them to <code>.SDcols</code> and for <code>LHS</code> (for better readability).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Note that since we allow assignment by reference without quoting column names when there is only one column as explained in <a href="#delete-convenience">Section 2c</a>, we can not do <code>out_cols := lapply(.SD, max)</code>. That would result in adding one new column named <code>out_col</code>. Instead we should do either <code>c(out_cols)</code> or simply <code>(out_cols)</code>. Wrapping the variable name with <code>(</code> is enough to differentiate between the two cases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>LHS := RHS</code> form allows us to operate on multiple columns. In the RHS, to compute the <code>max</code> on columns specified in <code>.SDcols</code>, we make use of the base function <code>lapply()</code> along with <code>.SD</code> in the same way as we have seen before in the <em>â€œIntroduction to data.tableâ€</em> vignette. It returns a list of two elements, containing the maximum value corresponding to <code>dep_delay</code> and <code>arr_delay</code> for each group.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s clean up again and convert our newly-made factor columns back into character columns.

<p>Note that the new column <code>speed</code> has been added to <code>flights</code> <em>data.table</em>. This is because <code>:=</code> performs operations by reference. Since <code>DT</code> (the function argument) and <code>flights</code> refer to the same object in memory, modifying <code>DT</code> also reflects on <code>flights</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And <code>ans</code> contains the maximum speed for each month.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="b-the-copy-function">b) The <code>copy()</code> function</h3>
<p>In the previous section, we used <code>:=</code> for its side effect. But of course this may not be always desirable. Sometimes, we would like to pass a <em>data.table</em> object to a function, and might want to use the <code>:=</code> operator, but <em>wouldnâ€™t</em> want to update the original object. We can accomplish this using the function <code>copy()</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>copy()</code> function <em>deep</em> copies the input object and therefore any subsequent update by reference operations performed on the copied object will not affect the original object.</p>
<h1></h1>
<p>There are two particular places where <code>copy()</code> function is essential:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Contrary to the situation we have seen in the previous point, we may not want the input data.table to a function to be modified <em>by reference</em>. As an example, letâ€™s consider the task in the previous section, except we donâ€™t want to modify <code>flights</code> by reference.</p>
<p>Letâ€™s first delete the <code>speed</code> column we generated in the previous section.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">flights[, speed := NULL]

<p>Now, we could accomplish the task as follows:</p>

This vignette discusses the default usage of reshaping functions `melt` (wide to long) and `dcast` (long to wide) for *data.tables* as well as the **new extended functionalities** of melting and casting on *multiple columns* available from `v1.9.6`.

***

```{r echo = FALSE}
options(width = 100L)
```

## Data

We will load the data sets directly within sections.

## Introduction

The `melt` and `dcast` functions for `data.table`s are for reshaping wide-to-long and long-to-wide, respectively; the implementations are specifically designed with large in-memory data (e.g. 10Gb) in mind.

In this vignette, we will

1. First briefly look at the default `melt`ing and `dcast`ing of `data.table`s to convert them from *wide* to *long* format and _vice versa_

2. Look at scenarios where the current functionalities become cumbersome and inefficient

3. Finally look at the new improvements to both `melt` and `dcast` methods for `data.table`s to handle multiple columns simultaneously.

The extended functionalities are in line with `data.table`'s philosophy of performing operations efficiently and in a straightforward manner.

## 1. Default functionality

### a) `melt`ing `data.table`s (wide to long)

Suppose we have a `data.table` (artificial data) as shown below:

```{r}
s1 <- "family_id age_mother dob_child1 dob_child2 dob_child3
1         30 1998-11-26 2000-01-29         NA
2         27 1996-06-22         NA         NA
3         26 2002-07-11 2004-04-05 2007-09-02
4         32 2004-10-10 2009-08-27 2012-07-21
5         29 2000-12-05 2005-02-28         NA"
DT <- fread(s1)
DT
## dob stands for date of birth.

str(DT)
```


#### - Convert `DT` to *long* form where each `dob` is a separate observation.

We could accomplish this using `melt()` by specifying `id.vars` and `measure.vars` arguments as follows:

```{r}
DT.m1 = melt(DT, id.vars = c("family_id", "age_mother"),
                measure.vars = c("dob_child1", "dob_child2", "dob_child3"))
DT.m1
str(DT.m1)
```

* `measure.vars` specify the set of columns we would like to collapse (or combine) together.

* We can also specify column *indices* instead of *names*.

* By default, `variable` column is of type `factor`. Set `variable.factor` argument to `FALSE` if you'd like to return a *`character`* vector instead.

* By default, the molten columns are automatically named `variable` and `value`.

* `melt` preserves column attributes in result.

#### - Name the `variable` and `value` columns to `child` and `dob` respectively


```{r}
DT.m1 = melt(DT, measure.vars = c("dob_child1", "dob_child2", "dob_child3"),
               variable.name = "child", value.name = "dob")
DT.m1
```

* By default, when one of `id.vars` or `measure.vars` is missing, the rest of the columns are *automatically assigned* to the missing argument.

* When neither `id.vars` nor `measure.vars` are specified, as mentioned under `?melt`, all *non*-`numeric`, `integer`, `logical` columns will be assigned to `id.vars`.

    In addition, a warning message is issued highlighting the columns that are automatically considered to be `id.vars`.

### b) `dcast`ing `data.table`s (long to wide)

In the previous section, we saw how to get from wide form to long form. Let's see the reverse operation in this section.

#### - How can we get back to the original data table `DT` from `DT.m1`?

That is, we'd like to collect all *child* observations corresponding to each `family_id, age_mother` together under the same row. We can accomplish it using `dcast` as follows:

```{r}
dcast(DT.m1, family_id + age_mother ~ child, value.var = "dob")
```

* `dcast` uses *formula* interface. The variables on the *LHS* of formula represents the *id* vars and *RHS* the *measure*  vars.

* `value.var` denotes the column to be filled in with while casting to wide format.

* `dcast` also tries to preserve attributes in result wherever possible.

#### - Starting from `DT.m1`, how can we get the number of children in each family?

You can also pass a function to aggregate by in `dcast` with the argument `fun.aggregate`. This is particularly essential when the formula provided does not identify single observation for each cell.

```{r}
dcast(DT.m1, family_id ~ ., fun.agg = function(x) sum(!is.na(x)), value.var = "dob")
```

Check `?dcast` for other useful arguments and additional examples.

## 2. Limitations in current `melt/dcast` approaches

So far we've seen features of `melt` and `dcast` that are implemented efficiently for `data.table`s, using internal `data.table` machinery (*fast radix ordering*, *binary search* etc.).

However, there are situations we might run into where the desired operation is not expressed in a straightforward manner. For example, consider the `data.table` shown below:

```{r}
s2 <- "family_id age_mother dob_child1 dob_child2 dob_child3 gender_child1 gender_child2 gender_child3

And you'd like to combine (`melt`) all the `dob` columns together, and `gender` columns together. Using the current functionality, we can do something like this:

```{r}
DT.m1 = melt(DT, id = c("family_id", "age_mother"))
DT.m1[, c("variable", "child") := tstrsplit(variable, "_", fixed = TRUE)]
DT.c1 = dcast(DT.m1, family_id + age_mother + child ~ variable, value.var = "value")
DT.c1

str(DT.c1) ## gender column is character type now!
```

#### Issues

1. What we wanted to do was to combine all the `dob` and `gender` type columns together respectively. Instead, we are combining *everything* together, and then splitting them again. I think it's easy to see that it's quite roundabout (and inefficient).

    As an analogy, imagine you've a closet with four shelves of clothes and you'd like to put together the clothes from shelves 1 and 2 together (in 1), and 3 and 4 together (in 3). What we are doing is more or less to combine all the clothes together, and then split them back on to shelves 1 and 3!

2. The columns to `melt` may be of different types, as in this case (`character` and `integer` types). By `melt`ing them all together, the columns will be coerced in result, as explained by the warning message above and shown from output of `str(DT.c1)`, where `gender` has been converted to *`character`* type.

3. We are generating an additional column by splitting the `variable` column into two columns, whose purpose is quite cryptic. We do it because we need it for *casting* in the next step.

4. Finally, we cast the data set. But the issue is it's a much more computationally involved operation than *melt*. Specifically, it requires computing the order of the variables in formula, and that's costly.

In fact, `stats::reshape` is capable of performing this operation in a very straightforward manner. It is an extremely useful and often underrated function. You should definitely give it a try!

## 3. Enhanced (new) functionality

### a) Enhanced `melt`

Since we'd like for `data.table`s to perform this operation straightforward and efficient using the same interface, we went ahead and implemented an *additional functionality*, where we can `melt` to multiple columns *simultaneously*.

#### - `melt` multiple columns simultaneously

The idea is quite simple. We pass a list of columns to `measure.vars`, where each element of the list contains the columns that should be combined together.

```{r}
colA = paste0("dob_child", 1:3)
colB = paste0("gender_child", 1:3)
DT.m2 = melt(DT, measure = list(colA, colB), value.name = c("dob", "gender"))
DT.m2

str(DT.m2) ## col type is preserved
```

* We can remove the `variable` column if necessary.

* The functionality is implemented entirely in C, and is therefore both *fast* and *memory efficient* in addition to being *straightforward*.

#### - Using `patterns()`

Usually in these problems, the columns we'd like to melt can be distinguished by a common pattern. We can use the function `patterns()`, implemented for convenience, to provide regular expressions for the columns to be combined together. The above operation can be rewritten as:

```{r}
DT.m2 = melt(DT, measure = patterns("^dob", "^gender"), value.name = c("dob", "gender"))
DT.m2
```

#### - Using `measure()` to specify `measure.vars` via separator or pattern

If, as in the data above, the input columns to melt have regular
names, then we can use `measure`, which allows specifying the columns
to melt via a separator or a regex. For example consider the iris
data,

```{r}
(two.iris = data.table(datasets::iris)[c(1,150)])
```

The iris data has four numeric columns with a regular structure: first
the flower part, then a period, then the measurement dimension. To
specify that we want to melt those four columns, we can use `measure`
with `sep="."` which means to use `strsplit` on all column names; the
columns which result in the maximum number of groups after splitting
will be used as `measure.vars`:

```{r}
melt(two.iris, measure.vars = measure(part, dim, sep="."))
```

The first two arguments to `measure` in the code above (`part` and
`dim`) are used to name the output columns; the number of arguments
must equal the max number of groups after splitting with `sep`.

If we want two value columns, one for each part, we can use the
special `value.name` keyword, which means to output a value column
for each unique name found in that group:

```{r}
melt(two.iris, measure.vars = measure(value.name, dim, sep="."))
```

Using the code above we get one value column per flower part. If we
instead want a value column for each measurement dimension, we can do

```{r}
melt(two.iris, measure.vars = measure(part, value.name, sep="."))
```

Going back to the example of the data with families and children, we
can see a more complex usage of `measure`, involving a function which
is used to convert the `child` string values to integers:

```{r}
DT.m3 = melt(DT, measure = measure(value.name, child=as.integer, sep="_child"))
DT.m3
```

In the code above we used `sep="_child"` which results in melting only
the columns which contain that string (six column names split into two
groups each). The `child=as.integer` argument means the second group
will result in an output column named `child` with values defined by
plugging the character strings from that group into the function
`as.integer`.

Finally we consider an example (borrowed from tidyr package) where we
need to define the groups using a regular expression rather than a
separator.

```{r}
(who <- data.table(id=1, new_sp_m5564=2, newrel_f65=3))
melt(who, measure.vars = measure(
  diagnosis, gender, ages, pattern="new_?(.*)_(.)(.*)"))
```

When using the `pattern` argument, it must be a Perl-compatible
regular expression containing the same number of capture groups
(parenthesized sub-expressions) as the number other arguments (group
names). The code below shows how to use a more complex regex with five
groups, two numeric output columns, and an anonymous type conversion
function,

```{r}
melt(who, measure.vars = measure(
  diagnosis, gender, ages,
  ymin=as.numeric,
  ymax=function(y) ifelse(nzchar(y), as.numeric(y), Inf),
  pattern="new_?(.*)_(.)(([0-9]{2})([0-9]{0,2}))"
))
```

### b) Enhanced `dcast`

Okay great! We can now melt into multiple columns simultaneously. Now given the data set `DT.m2` as shown above, how can we get back to the same format as the original data we started with?

If we use the current functionality of `dcast`, then we'd have to cast twice and bind the results together. But that's once again verbose, not straightforward and is also inefficient.

#### - Casting multiple `value.var`s simultaneously

We can now provide **multiple `value.var` columns** to `dcast` for `data.table`s directly so that the operations are taken care of internally and efficiently.

```{r}
## new 'cast' functionality - multiple value.vars
DT.c2 = dcast(DT.m2, family_id + age_mother ~ variable, value.var = c("dob", "gender"))
DT.c2
```

* Attributes are preserved in result wherever possible.

* Everything is taken care of internally, and efficiently. In addition to being fast, it is also very memory efficient.

#

#### Multiple functions to `fun.aggregate`:

You can also provide *multiple functions* to `fun.aggregate` to `dcast` for *data.tables*. Check the examples in `?dcast` which illustrates this functionality.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
setDTthreads(.old.th)
```

<h4 id="issues">Issues</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What we wanted to do was to combine all the <code>dob</code> and <code>gender</code> type columns together respectively. Instead, we are combining <em>everything</em> together, and then splitting them again. I think itâ€™s easy to see that itâ€™s quite roundabout (and inefficient).</p>
<p>As an analogy, imagine youâ€™ve a closet with four shelves of clothes and youâ€™d like to put together the clothes from shelves 1 and 2 together (in 1), and 3 and 4 together (in 3). What we are doing is more or less to combine all the clothes together, and then split them back on to shelves 1 and 3!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The columns to <code>melt</code> may be of different types, as in this case (<code>character</code> and <code>integer</code> types). By <code>melt</code>ing them all together, the columns will be coerced in result, as explained by the warning message above and shown from output of <code>str(DT.c1)</code>, where <code>gender</code> has been converted to <em><code>character</code></em> type.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are generating an additional column by splitting the <code>variable</code> column into two columns, whose purpose is quite cryptic. We do it because we need it for <em>casting</em> in the next step.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, we cast the data set. But the issue is itâ€™s a much more computationally involved operation than <em>melt</em>. Specifically, it requires computing the order of the variables in formula, and thatâ€™s costly.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In fact, <code>stats::reshape</code> is capable of performing this operation in a very straightforward manner. It is an extremely useful and often underrated function. You should definitely give it a try!</p>
<h2 id="3-enhanced-new-functionality">3. Enhanced (new) functionality</h2>
<h3 id="a-enhanced-melt">a) Enhanced <code>melt</code></h3>
<p>Since weâ€™d like for <code>data.table</code>s to perform this operation straightforward and efficient using the same interface, we went ahead and implemented an <em>additional functionality</em>, where we can <code>melt</code> to multiple columns <em>simultaneously</em>.</p>
<h4 id="melt-multiple-columns-simultaneously">- <code>melt</code> multiple columns simultaneously</h4>
<p>The idea is quite simple. We pass a list of columns to <code>measure.vars</code>, where each element of the list contains the columns that should be combined together.</p>

<h4 id="using-measure-to-specify-measure-vars-via-separator-or-pattern">- Using <code>measure()</code> to specify <code>measure.vars</code> via separator or pattern</h4>
<p>If, as in the data above, the input columns to melt have regular
names, then we can use <code>measure</code>, which allows specifying the columns
to melt via a separator or a regex. For example consider the iris
data,</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">(two.iris = data.table(datasets::iris)[c(1,150)])
#    Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width   Species
#           &lt;num&gt;       &lt;num&gt;        &lt;num&gt;       &lt;num&gt;    &lt;fctr&gt;
# 1:          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2    setosa
# 2:          5.9         3.0          5.1         1.8 virginica
</code></pre>
<p>The iris data has four numeric columns with a regular structure: first
the flower part, then a period, then the measurement dimension. To
specify that we want to melt those four columns, we can use <code>measure</code>
with <code>sep=&quot;.&quot;</code> which means to use <code>strsplit</code> on all column names; the
columns which result in the maximum number of groups after splitting
will be used as <code>measure.vars</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">melt(two.iris, measure.vars = measure(part, dim, sep=&quot;.&quot;))
#      Species   part    dim value
#       &lt;fctr&gt; &lt;char&gt; &lt;char&gt; &lt;num&gt;
# 1:    setosa  Sepal Length   5.1
# 2: virginica  Sepal Length   5.9
# 3:    setosa  Sepal  Width   3.5
# 4: virginica  Sepal  Width   3.0
# 5:    setosa  Petal Length   1.4
# 6: virginica  Petal Length   5.1
# 7:    setosa  Petal  Width   0.2
# 8: virginica  Petal  Width   1.8
</code></pre>
<p>The first two arguments to <code>measure</code> in the code above (<code>part</code> and
<code>dim</code>) are used to name the output columns; the number of arguments
must equal the max number of groups after splitting with <code>sep</code>.</p>
<p>If we want two value columns, one for each part, we can use the
special <code>value.name</code> keyword, which means to output a value column
for each unique name found in that group:</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">melt(two.iris, measure.vars = measure(value.name, dim, sep=&quot;.&quot;))
#      Species    dim Sepal Petal
#       &lt;fctr&gt; &lt;char&gt; &lt;num&gt; &lt;num&gt;
# 1:    setosa Length   5.1   1.4
# 2: virginica Length   5.9   5.1
# 3:    setosa  Width   3.5   0.2
# 4: virginica  Width   3.0   1.8
</code></pre>
<p>Using the code above we get one value column per flower part. If we
instead want a value column for each measurement dimension, we can do</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">melt(two.iris, measure.vars = measure(part, value.name, sep=&quot;.&quot;))
#      Species   part Length Width
#       &lt;fctr&gt; &lt;char&gt;  &lt;num&gt; &lt;num&gt;
# 1:    setosa  Sepal    5.1   3.5
# 2: virginica  Sepal    5.9   3.0
# 3:    setosa  Petal    1.4   0.2
# 4: virginica  Petal    5.1   1.8
</code></pre>
<p>Going back to the example of the data with families and children, we
can see a more complex usage of <code>measure</code>, involving a function which
is used to convert the <code>child</code> string values to integers:</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">DT.m3 = melt(DT, measure = measure(value.name, child=as.integer, sep=&quot;_child&quot;))
DT.m3

<p>In the code above we used <code>sep=&quot;_child&quot;</code> which results in melting only
the columns which contain that string (six column names split into two
groups each). The <code>child=as.integer</code> argument means the second group
will result in an output column named <code>child</code> with values defined by
plugging the character strings from that group into the function
<code>as.integer</code>.</p>
<p>Finally we consider an example (borrowed from tidyr package) where we
need to define the groups using a regular expression rather than a
separator.</p>

This vignette will explain the most common ways to use the `.SD` variable in your `data.table` analyses. It is an adaptation of [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/47406952/3576984) given on StackOverflow.

# What is `.SD`?

In the broadest sense, `.SD` is just shorthand for capturing a variable that comes up frequently in the context of data analysis. It can be understood to stand for *S*ubset, *S*elfsame, or *S*elf-reference of the *D*ata. That is, `.SD` is in its most basic guise a _reflexive reference_ to the `data.table` itself -- as we'll see in examples below, this is particularly helpful for chaining together "queries" (extractions/subsets/etc using `[`). In particular, this also means that `.SD` is _itself a `data.table`_ (with the caveat that it does not allow assignment with `:=`).

The simpler usage of `.SD` is for column subsetting (i.e., when `.SDcols` is specified); as this version is much more straightforward to understand, we'll cover that first below. The interpretation of `.SD` in its second usage, grouping scenarios (i.e., when `by = ` or `keyby = ` is specified), is slightly different, conceptually (though at core it's the same, since, after all, a non-grouped operation is an edge case of grouping with just one group).

## Loading and Previewing Lahman Data

To give this a more real-world feel, rather than making up data, let's load some data sets about baseball from the [Lahman database](https://github.com/cdalzell/Lahman). In typical R usage, we'd simply load these data sets from the `Lahman` R package; in this vignette, we've pre-downloaded them directly from the package's GitHub page instead.

```{r download_lahman}
load('Teams.RData')
setDT(Teams)
Teams

load('Pitching.RData')
setDT(Pitching)
Pitching
```

Readers up on baseball lingo should find the tables' contents familiar; `Teams` records some statistics for a given team in a given year, while `Pitching` records statistics for a given pitcher in a given year. Please do check out the [documentation](https://github.com/cdalzell/Lahman) and explore the data yourself a bit before proceeding to familiarize yourself with their structure.

# `.SD` on Ungrouped Data

To illustrate what I mean about the reflexive nature of `.SD`, consider its most banal usage:

```{r plain_sd}
Pitching[ , .SD]
```

That is, `Pitching[ , .SD]` has simply returned the whole table, i.e., this was an overly verbose way of writing `Pitching` or `Pitching[]`:

```{r plain_sd_is_table}
identical(Pitching, Pitching[ , .SD])
```

In terms of subsetting, `.SD` is still a subset of the data, it's just a trivial one (the set itself).

## Column Subsetting: `.SDcols`

The first way to impact what `.SD` is is to limit the _columns_ contained in `.SD` using the `.SDcols` argument to `[`:

```{r simple_sdcols}
# W: Wins; L: Losses; G: Games
Pitching[ , .SD, .SDcols = c('W', 'L', 'G')]
```

This is just for illustration and was pretty boring. In addition to accepting a character vector, `.SDcols` also accepts:

1. any function such as `is.character` to filter _columns_
2. the function^{*} `patterns()` to filter _column names_ by regular expression
3. integer and logical vectors

*see `?patterns` for more details

This simple usage lends itself to a wide variety of highly beneficial / ubiquitous data manipulation operations:

## Column Type Conversion

Column type conversion is a fact of life for data munging. Though [`fwrite` recently gained the ability to declare the class of each column up front](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/pull/2545), not all data sets come from `fread` (e.g. in this vignette) and conversions back and forth among `character`/`factor`/`numeric` types are common. We can use `.SD` and `.SDcols` to batch-convert groups of columns to a common type.

We notice that the following columns are stored as `character` in the `Teams` data set, but might more logically be stored as `factor`s:

```{r identify_factors}
# teamIDBR: Team ID used by Baseball Reference website
# teamIDlahman45: Team ID used in Lahman database version 4.5
# teamIDretro: Team ID used by Retrosheet
fkt = c('teamIDBR', 'teamIDlahman45', 'teamIDretro')
# confirm that they're stored as `character`
str(Teams[ , ..fkt])
```

The syntax to now convert these columns to `factor` is simple:

```{r assign_factors}
Teams[ , names(.SD) := lapply(.SD, factor), .SDcols = patterns('teamID')]
# print out the first column to demonstrate success
head(unique(Teams[[fkt[1L]]]))
```

Note: 

1. The `:=` is an assignment operator to update the `data.table` in place without making a copy. See [reference semantics](https://cran.r-project.org/package=data.table/vignettes/datatable-reference-semantics.html) for more. 
2. The LHS, `names(.SD)`, indicates which columns we are updating - in this case we update the entire `.SD`.
3. The RHS, `lapply()`, loops through each column of the `.SD` and converts the column to a factor.
4. We use the `.SDcols` to only select columns that have pattern of `teamID`.

Again, the `.SDcols` argument is quite flexible; above, we supplied `patterns` but we could have also supplied `fkt` or any `character` vector of column names. In other situations, it is more convenient to supply an `integer` vector of column _positions_ or a `logical` vector dictating include/exclude for each column. Finally, the use of a function to filter columns is very helpful.

For example, we could do the following to convert all `factor` columns to `character`:

```{r sd_as_logical}
fct_idx = Teams[, which(sapply(.SD, is.factor))] # column numbers to show the class changing
str(Teams[[fct_idx[1L]]])
Teams[ , names(.SD) := lapply(.SD, as.character), .SDcols = is.factor]
str(Teams[[fct_idx[1L]]])
```

Lastly, we can do pattern-based matching of columns in `.SDcols` to select all columns which contain `team` back to `factor`:

```{r sd_patterns}
Teams[ , .SD, .SDcols = patterns('team')]
Teams[ , names(.SD) := lapply(.SD, factor), .SDcols = patterns('team')]
```

** A proviso to the above: _explicitly_ using column numbers (like `DT[ , (1) := rnorm(.N)]`) is bad practice and can lead to silently corrupted code over time if column positions change. Even implicitly using numbers can be dangerous if we don't keep smart/strict control over the ordering of when we create the numbered index and when we use it.

## Controlling a Model's Right-Hand Side

Varying model specification is a core feature of robust statistical analysis. Let's try and predict a pitcher's ERA (Earned Runs Average, a measure of performance) using the small set of covariates available in the `Pitching` table. How does the (linear) relationship between `W` (wins) and `ERA` vary depending on which other covariates are included in the specification?

Here's a short script leveraging the power of `.SD` which explores this question:

```{r sd_for_lm, cache = FALSE, fig.cap="Fit OLS coefficient on W, various specifications, depicted as bars with distinct colors."}
# this generates a list of the 2^k possible extra variables
#   for models of the form ERA ~ G + (...)
extra_var = c('yearID', 'teamID', 'G', 'L')
models = unlist(
  lapply(0L:length(extra_var), combn, x = extra_var, simplify = FALSE),
  recursive = FALSE
)

# here are 16 visually distinct colors, taken from the list of 20 here:
#   https://sashat.me/2017/01/11/list-of-20-simple-distinct-colors/
col16 = c('#e6194b', '#3cb44b', '#ffe119', '#0082c8',
          '#f58231', '#911eb4', '#46f0f0', '#f032e6',
          '#d2f53c', '#fabebe', '#008080', '#e6beff',
          '#aa6e28', '#fffac8', '#800000', '#aaffc3')

par(oma = c(2, 0, 0, 0))
lm_coef = sapply(models, function(rhs) {
  # using ERA ~ . and data = .SD, then varying which
  #   columns are included in .SD allows us to perform this
  #   iteration over 16 models succinctly.
  #   coef(.)['W'] extracts the W coefficient from each model fit
  Pitching[ , coef(lm(ERA ~ ., data = .SD))['W'], .SDcols = c('W', rhs)]
})
barplot(lm_coef, names.arg = sapply(models, paste, collapse = '/'),
        main = 'Wins Coefficient\nWith Various Covariates',
        col = col16, las = 2L, cex.names = 0.8)
```

The coefficient always has the expected sign (better pitchers tend to have more wins and fewer runs allowed), but the magnitude can vary substantially depending on what else we control for.

## Conditional Joins

`data.table` syntax is beautiful for its simplicity and robustness. The syntax `x[i]` flexibly handles three common approaches to subsetting -- when `i` is a `logical` vector, `x[i]` will return those rows of `x` corresponding to where `i` is `TRUE`; when `i` is _another `data.table`_ (or a `list`), a (right) `join` is performed (in the plain form, using the `key`s of `x` and `i`, otherwise, when `on = ` is specified, using matches of those columns); and when `i` is a character, it is interpreted as shorthand for `x[list(i)]`, i.e., as a join.

This is great in general, but falls short when we wish to perform a _conditional join_, wherein the exact nature of the relationship among tables depends on some characteristics of the rows in one or more columns.

This example is admittedly a tad contrived, but illustrates the idea; see here ([1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31329939/conditional-keyed-join-update-and-update-a-flag-column-for-matches), [2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29658627/conditional-binary-join-and-update-by-reference-using-the-data-table-package)) for more.

The goal is to add a column `team_performance` to the `Pitching` table that records the team's performance (rank) of the best pitcher on each team (as measured by the lowest ERA, among pitchers with at least 6 recorded games).

```{r conditional_join}
# to exclude pitchers with exceptional performance in a few games,
#   subset first; then define rank of pitchers within their team each year
#   (in general, we should put more care into the 'ties.method' of frank)
Pitching[G > 5, rank_in_team := frank(ERA), by = .(teamID, yearID)]
Pitching[rank_in_team == 1, team_performance :=
           Teams[.SD, Rank, on = c('teamID', 'yearID')]]
```

Note that the `x[y]` syntax returns `nrow(y)` values (i.e., it's a right join), which is why `.SD` is on the right in `Teams[.SD]` (since the RHS of `:=` in this case requires `nrow(Pitching[rank_in_team == 1])` values).

# Grouped `.SD` operations

Often, we'd like to perform some operation on our data _at the group level_. When we specify `by =` (or `keyby = `), the mental model for what happens when `data.table` processes `j` is to think of your `data.table` as being split into many component sub-`data.table`s, each of which corresponds to a single value of your `by` variable(s):

![Grouping, Illustrated](plots/grouping_illustration.png)
<!-- 'A visual depiction of how grouping works. On the left is a grid. The first column is titled "ID COLUMN" with values the capital letters A through G, and the rest of the data is unlabelled, but is in a darker color and simply has "Data" written to indicate that's arbitrary. A right arrow shows how this data is split into groups. Each capital letter A through G has a grid on the right-hand side; the grid on the left has been subdivided to create that on the right.' -->

In the case of grouping, `.SD` is multiple in nature -- it refers to _each_ of these sub-`data.table`s, _one-at-a-time_ (slightly more accurately, the scope of `.SD` is a single sub-`data.table`). This allows us to concisely express an operation that we'd like to perform on _each sub-`data.table`_ before the re-assembled result is returned to us.

This is useful in a variety of settings, the most common of which are presented here:

## Group Subsetting

Let's get the most recent season of data for each team in the Lahman data. This can be done quite simply with:

```{r group_sd_last}
# the data is already sorted by year; if it weren't
#   we could do Teams[order(yearID), .SD[.N], by = teamID]
Teams[ , .SD[.N], by = teamID]
```

Recall that `.SD` is itself a `data.table`, and that `.N` refers to the total number of rows in a group (it's equal to `nrow(.SD)` within each group), so `.SD[.N]` returns the _entirety of `.SD`_ for the final row associated with each `teamID`.

Another common version of this is to use `.SD[1L]` instead to get the _first_ observation for each group, or `.SD[sample(.N, 1L)]` to return a _random_ row for each group.

## Group Optima

Suppose we wanted to return the _best_ year for each team, as measured by their total number of runs scored (`R`; we could easily adjust this to refer to other metrics, of course). Instead of taking a _fixed_ element from each sub-`data.table`, we now define the desired index _dynamically_ as follows:

```{r sd_team_best_year}
Teams[ , .SD[which.max(R)], by = teamID]
```

Note that this approach can of course be combined with `.SDcols` to return only portions of the `data.table` for each `.SD` (with the caveat that `.SDcols` should be fixed across the various subsets)

_NB_: `.SD[1L]` is currently optimized by [_`GForce`_](https://Rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/library/data.table/html/datatable-optimize.html) ([see also](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22137591/about-gforce-in-data-table-1-9-2)), `data.table` internals which massively speed up the most common grouped operations like `sum` or `mean` -- see `?GForce` for more details and keep an eye on/voice support for feature improvement requests for updates on this front: [1](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/735), [2](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/2778), [3](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/523), [4](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/971), [5](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/1197), [6](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/1414)

## Grouped Regression

Returning to the inquiry above regarding the relationship between `ERA` and `W`, suppose we expect this relationship to differ by team (i.e., there's a different slope for each team). We can easily re-run this regression to explore the heterogeneity in this relationship as follows (noting that the standard errors from this approach are generally incorrect -- the specification `ERA ~ W*teamID` will be better -- this approach is easier to read and the _coefficients_ are OK):

```{r group_lm, results = 'hide', fig.cap="A histogram depicting the distribution of fitted coefficients. It is vaguely bell-shaped and concentrated around -.2"}
# Overall coefficient for comparison
overall_coef = Pitching[ , coef(lm(ERA ~ W))['W']]
# use the .N > 20 filter to exclude teams with few observations
Pitching[ , if (.N > 20L) .(w_coef = coef(lm(ERA ~ W))['W']), by = teamID
          ][ , hist(w_coef, 20L, las = 1L,
                    xlab = 'Fitted Coefficient on W',
                    ylab = 'Number of Teams', col = 'darkgreen',
                    main = 'Team-Level Distribution\nWin Coefficients on ERA')]
abline(v = overall_coef, lty = 2L, col = 'red')
```

While there is indeed a fair amount of heterogeneity, there's a distinct concentration around the observed overall value.

The above is just a short introduction of the power of `.SD` in facilitating beautiful, efficient code in `data.table`!

<p>This vignette will explain the most common ways to use the <code>.SD</code> variable in your <code>data.table</code> analyses. It is an adaptation of <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/47406952/3576984">this answer</a> given on StackOverflow.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-sd"><span class="section-number">1.</span> What is <code>.SD</code>?</h1>
<p>In the broadest sense, <code>.SD</code> is just shorthand for capturing a variable that comes up frequently in the context of data analysis. It can be understood to stand for <em>S</em>ubset, <em>S</em>elfsame, or <em>S</em>elf-reference of the <em>D</em>ata. That is, <code>.SD</code> is in its most basic guise a <em>reflexive reference</em> to the <code>data.table</code> itself â€“ as weâ€™ll see in examples below, this is particularly helpful for chaining together â€œqueriesâ€ (extractions/subsets/etc using <code>[</code>). In particular, this also means that <code>.SD</code> is <em>itself a <code>data.table</code></em> (with the caveat that it does not allow assignment with <code>:=</code>).</p>
<p>The simpler usage of <code>.SD</code> is for column subsetting (i.e., when <code>.SDcols</code> is specified); as this version is much more straightforward to understand, weâ€™ll cover that first below. The interpretation of <code>.SD</code> in its second usage, grouping scenarios (i.e., when <code>by = </code> or <code>keyby = </code> is specified), is slightly different, conceptually (though at core itâ€™s the same, since, after all, a non-grouped operation is an edge case of grouping with just one group).</p>
<h2 id="loading-and-previewing-lahman-data"><span class="section-number">1.1</span> Loading and Previewing Lahman Data</h2>
<p>To give this a more real-world feel, rather than making up data, letâ€™s load some data sets about baseball from the <a href="https://github.com/cdalzell/Lahman">Lahman database</a>. In typical R usage, weâ€™d simply load these data sets from the <code>Lahman</code> R package; in this vignette, weâ€™ve pre-downloaded them directly from the packageâ€™s GitHub page instead.</p>

<p>Readers up on baseball lingo should find the tablesâ€™ contents familiar; <code>Teams</code> records some statistics for a given team in a given year, while <code>Pitching</code> records statistics for a given pitcher in a given year.

<p>That is, <code>Pitching[ , .SD]</code> has simply returned the whole table, i.e., this was an overly verbose way of writing <code>Pitching</code> or <code>Pitching[]</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">identical(Pitching, Pitching[ , .SD])
# [1] TRUE
</code></pre>
<p>In terms of subsetting, <code>.SD</code> is still a subset of the data, itâ€™s just a trivial one (the set itself).</p>
<h2 id="column-subsetting-sdcols"><span class="section-number">2.1</span> Column Subsetting: <code>.SDcols</code></h2>
<p>The first way to impact what <code>.SD</code> is is to limit the <em>columns</em> contained in <code>.SD</code> using the <code>.SDcols</code> argument to <code>[</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-r"># W: Wins; L: Losses; G: Games

<p>This is just for illustration and was pretty boring. In addition to accepting a character vector, <code>.SDcols</code> also accepts:</p>
<ol>
<li>any function such as <code>is.character</code> to filter <em>columns</em></li>
<li>the function^{*} <code>patterns()</code> to filter <em>column names</em> by regular expression</li>
<li>integer and logical vectors</li>
</ol>
<p>*see <code>?patterns</code> for more details</p>
<p>This simple usage lends itself to a wide variety of highly beneficial / ubiquitous data manipulation operations:</p>
<h2 id="column-type-conversion"><span class="section-number">2.2</span> Column Type Conversion</h2>
<p>Column type conversion is a fact of life for data munging. Though <a href="https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/pull/2545"><code>fwrite</code> recently gained the ability to declare the class of each column up front</a>, not all data sets come from <code>fread</code> (e.g. in this vignette) and conversions back and forth among <code>character</code>/<code>factor</code>/<code>numeric</code> types are common. We can use <code>.SD</code> and <code>.SDcols</code> to batch-convert groups of columns to a common type.</p>
<p>We notice that the following columns are stored as <code>character</code> in the <code>Teams</code> data set, but might more logically be stored as <code>factor</code>s:</p>
<pre><code class="language-r"># teamIDBR: Team ID used by Baseball Reference website
# teamIDlahman45: Team ID used in Lahman database version 4.5
# teamIDretro: Team ID used by Retrosheet
fkt = c('teamIDBR', 'teamIDlahman45', 'teamIDretro')
# confirm that they're stored as `character`
str(Teams[ , ..fkt])
# Classes 'data.table' and 'data.frame':	2895 obs. of  3 variables:
#  $ teamIDBR      : chr  &quot;BOS&quot; &quot;CHI&quot; &quot;CLE&quot; &quot;KEK&quot; ...
#  $ teamIDlahman45: chr  &quot;BS1&quot; &quot;CH1&quot; &quot;CL1&quot; &quot;FW1&quot; ...
#  $ teamIDretro   : chr  &quot;BS1&quot; &quot;CH1&quot; &quot;CL1&quot; &quot;FW1&quot; ...
#  - attr(*, &quot;.internal.selfref&quot;)=&lt;externalptr&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The syntax to now convert these columns to <code>factor</code> is simple:</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">Teams[ , names(.SD) := lapply(.SD, factor), .SDcols = patterns('teamID')]
# print out the first column to demonstrate success
head(unique(Teams[[fkt[1L]]]))
# [1] BOS CHI CLE KEK NYU ATH
# 101 Levels: ALT ANA ARI ATH ATL BAL BLA BLN BLU BOS BRA BRG BRO BSN BTT BUF BWW CAL CEN CHC ... WSN
</code></pre>
<p>Note:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <code>:=</code> is an assignment operator to update the <code>data.table</code> in place without making a copy. See <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=data.table/vignettes/datatable-reference-semantics.html">reference semantics</a> for more.</li>
<li>The LHS, <code>names(.SD)</code>, indicates which columns we are updating - in this case we update the entire <code>.SD</code>.</li>
<li>The RHS, <code>lapply()</code>, loops through each column of the <code>.SD</code> and converts the column to a factor.</li>
<li>We use the <code>.SDcols</code> to only select columns that have pattern of <code>teamID</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, the <code>.SDcols</code> argument is quite flexible; above, we supplied <code>patterns</code> but we could have also supplied <code>fkt</code> or any <code>character</code> vector of column names. In other situations, it is more convenient to supply an <code>integer</code> vector of column <em>positions</em> or a <code>logical</code> vector dictating include/exclude for each column. Finally, the use of a function to filter columns is very helpful.</p>
<p>For example, we could do the following to convert all <code>factor</code> columns to <code>character</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">fct_idx = Teams[, which(sapply(.SD, is.factor))] # column numbers to show the class changing
str(Teams[[fct_idx[1L]]])
#  Factor w/ 7 levels &quot;AA&quot;,&quot;AL&quot;,&quot;FL&quot;,..: 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 ...
Teams[ , names(.SD) := lapply(.SD, as.character), .SDcols = is.factor]
str(Teams[[fct_idx[1L]]])
#  chr [1:2895] &quot;NA&quot; &quot;NA&quot; &quot;NA&quot; &quot;NA&quot; &quot;NA&quot; &quot;NA&quot; &quot;NA&quot; &quot;NA&quot; &quot;NA&quot; &quot;NA&quot; &quot;NA&quot; &quot;NA&quot; &quot;NA&quot; &quot;NA&quot; &quot;NA&quot; &quot;NA&quot; ...
</code></pre>
<p>Lastly, we can do pattern-based matching of columns in <code>.SDcols</code> to select all columns which contain <code>team</code> back to <code>factor</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">Teams[ , .SD, .SDcols = patterns('team')]

<p>** A proviso to the above: <em>explicitly</em> using column numbers (like <code>DT[ , (1) := rnorm(.N)]</code>) is bad practice and can lead to silently corrupted code over time if column positions change. Even implicitly using numbers can be dangerous if we donâ€™t keep smart/strict control over the ordering of when we create the numbered index and when we use it.</p>

<p>Varying model specification is a core feature of robust statistical analysis. Letâ€™s try and predict a pitcherâ€™s ERA (Earned Runs Average, a measure of performance) using the small set of covariates available in the <code>Pitching</code> table. How does the (linear) relationship between <code>W</code> (wins) and <code>ERA</code> vary depending on which other covariates are included in the specification?</p>
<p>Hereâ€™s a short script leveraging the power of <code>.SD</code> which explores this question:</p>

  #   coef(.)['W'] extracts the W coefficient from each model fit

<p class="caption">Fit OLS coefficient on W, various specifications, depicted as bars with distinct colors.</p>

<p>The coefficient always has the expected sign (better pitchers tend to have more wins and fewer runs allowed), but the magnitude can vary substantially depending on what else we control for.</p>
<h2 id="conditional-joins"><span class="section-number">2.4</span> Conditional Joins</h2>
<p><code>data.table</code> syntax is beautiful for its simplicity and robustness. The syntax <code>x[i]</code> flexibly handles three common approaches to subsetting â€“ when <code>i</code> is a <code>logical</code> vector, <code>x[i]</code> will return those rows of <code>x</code> corresponding to where <code>i</code> is <code>TRUE</code>; when <code>i</code> is <em>another <code>data.table</code></em> (or a <code>list</code>), a (right) <code>join</code> is performed (in the plain form, using the <code>key</code>s of <code>x</code> and <code>i</code>, otherwise, when <code>on = </code> is specified, using matches of those columns); and when <code>i</code> is a character, it is interpreted as shorthand for <code>x[list(i)]</code>, i.e., as a join.</p>
<p>This is great in general, but falls short when we wish to perform a <em>conditional join</em>, wherein the exact nature of the relationship among tables depends on some characteristics of the rows in one or more columns.</p>
<p>This example is admittedly a tad contrived, but illustrates the idea; see here (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31329939/conditional-keyed-join-update-and-update-a-flag-column-for-matches">1</a>, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29658627/conditional-binary-join-and-update-by-reference-using-the-data-table-package">2</a>) for more.</p>
<p>The goal is to add a column <code>team_performance</code> to the <code>Pitching</code> table that records the teamâ€™s performance (rank) of the best pitcher on each team (as measured by the lowest ERA, among pitchers with at least 6 recorded games).</p>
<pre><code class="language-r"># to exclude pitchers with exceptional performance in a few games,
#   subset first; then define rank of pitchers within their team each year
#   (in general, we should put more care into the 'ties.method' of frank)
Pitching[G &gt; 5, rank_in_team := frank(ERA), by = .(teamID, yearID)]
Pitching[rank_in_team == 1, team_performance :=
           Teams[.SD, Rank, on = c('teamID', 'yearID')]]
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the <code>x[y]</code> syntax returns <code>nrow(y)</code> values (i.e., itâ€™s a right join), which is why <code>.SD</code> is on the right in <code>Teams[.SD]</code> (since the RHS of <code>:=</code> in this case requires <code>nrow(Pitching[rank_in_team == 1])</code> values).</p>
<h1 id="grouped-sd-operations"><span class="section-number">3.</span> Grouped <code>.SD</code> operations</h1>
<p>Often, weâ€™d like to perform some operation on our data <em>at the group level</em>. When we specify <code>by =</code> (or <code>keyby = </code>), the mental model for what happens when <code>data.table</code> processes <code>j</code> is to think of your <code>data.table</code> as being split into many component sub-<code>data.table</code>s, each of which corresponds to a single value of your <code>by</code> variable(s):</p>

<!-- 'A visual depiction of how grouping works. On the left is a grid. The first column is titled "ID COLUMN" with values the capital letters A through G, and the rest of the data is unlabelled, but is in a darker color and simply has "Data" written to indicate that's arbitrary. A right arrow shows how this data is split into groups. Each capital letter A through G has a grid on the right-hand side; the grid on the left has been subdivided to create that on the right.' -->
<p>In the case of grouping, <code>.SD</code> is multiple in nature â€“ it refers to <em>each</em> of these sub-<code>data.table</code>s, <em>one-at-a-time</em> (slightly more accurately, the scope of <code>.SD</code> is a single sub-<code>data.table</code>). This allows us to concisely express an operation that weâ€™d like to perform on <em>each sub-<code>data.table</code></em> before the re-assembled result is returned to us.</p>
<p>This is useful in a variety of settings, the most common of which are presented here:</p>

<p>Recall that <code>.SD</code> is itself a <code>data.table</code>, and that <code>.N</code> refers to the total number of rows in a group (itâ€™s equal to <code>nrow(.SD)</code> within each group), so <code>.SD[.N]</code> returns the <em>entirety of <code>.SD</code></em> for the final row associated with each <code>teamID</code>.</p>
<p>Another common version of this is to use <code>.SD[1L]</code> instead to get the <em>first</em> observation for each group, or <code>.SD[sample(.N, 1L)]</code> to return a <em>random</em> row for each group.</p>

<p>Suppose we wanted to return the <em>best</em> year for each team, as measured by their total number of runs scored (<code>R</code>; we could easily adjust this to refer to other metrics, of course). Instead of taking a <em>fixed</em> element from each sub-<code>data.table</code>, we now define the desired index <em>dynamically</em> as follows:</p>

<p>Returning to the inquiry above regarding the relationship between <code>ERA</code> and <code>W</code>, suppose we expect this relationship to differ by team (i.e., thereâ€™s a different slope for each team). We can easily re-run this regression to explore the heterogeneity in this relationship as follows (noting that the standard errors from this approach are generally incorrect â€“ the specification <code>ERA ~ W*teamID</code> will be better â€“ this approach is easier to read and the <em>coefficients</em> are OK):</p>

This vignette assumes that the reader is familiar with data.table's `[i, j, by]` syntax, and how to perform fast key based subsets. If you're not familiar with these concepts, please read the *"Introduction to data.table"*,  *"Reference semantics"* and *"Keys and fast binary search based subset"* vignettes first.

***

## Data {#data}

We will use the same `flights` data as in the *"Introduction to data.table"* vignette.

```{r echo = FALSE}
options(width = 100L)
```

```{r}
flights <- fread("flights14.csv")
head(flights)
dim(flights)
```

## Introduction

In this vignette, we will

* discuss *secondary indices* and provide rationale as to why we need them by citing cases where setting keys is not necessarily ideal,

* perform fast subsetting, once again, but using the new `on` argument, which computes secondary indices internally for the task (temporarily), and reuses if one already exists,

* and finally look at *auto indexing* which goes a step further and creates secondary indices automatically, but does so on native R syntax for subsetting.

## 1. Secondary indices

### a) What are secondary indices?

Secondary indices are similar to `keys` in *data.table*, except for two major differences:

* It *doesn't* physically reorder the entire data.table in RAM. Instead, it only computes the order for the set of columns provided and stores that *order vector* in an additional attribute called `index`.

* There can be more than one secondary index for a data.table (as we will see below).

### b) Set and get secondary indices

#### -- How can we set the column `origin` as a secondary index in the *data.table* `flights`?

```{r}
setindex(flights, origin)
head(flights)

## alternatively we can provide character vectors to the function 'setindexv()'
# setindexv(flights, "origin") # useful to program with

# 'index' attribute added
names(attributes(flights))
```

* `setindex` and `setindexv()` allows adding a secondary index to the data.table.

* Note that `flights` is **not** physically reordered in increasing order of `origin`, as would have been the case with `setkey()`.

* Also note that the attribute `index` has been added to `flights`.

* `setindex(flights, NULL)` would remove all secondary indices.

#### -- How can we get all the secondary indices set so far in `flights`?

```{r}
indices(flights)

setindex(flights, origin, dest)
indices(flights)
```

* The function `indices()` returns all current secondary indices in the data.table. If none exists, `NULL` is returned.

* Note that by creating another index on the columns `origin, dest`, we do not lose the first index created on the column `origin`, i.e., we can have multiple secondary indices.

### c) Why do we need secondary indices?

#### -- Reordering a data.table can be expensive and not always ideal

Consider the case where you would like to perform a fast key based subset on `origin` column for the value "JFK". We'd do this as:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## not run
setkey(flights, origin)
flights["JFK"] # or flights[.("JFK")]
```

#### `setkey()` requires:

a) computing the order vector for the column(s) provided, here, `origin`, and

b) reordering the entire data.table, by reference, based on the order vector computed.

#

Computing the order isn't the time consuming part, since data.table uses true radix sorting on integer, character and numeric vectors. However, reordering the data.table could be time consuming (depending on the number of rows and columns).

Unless our task involves repeated subsetting on the same column, fast key based subsetting could effectively be nullified by the time to reorder, depending on our data.table dimensions.

#### -- There can be only one `key` at the most

Now if we would like to repeat the same operation but on `dest` column instead, for the value "LAX", then we have to `setkey()`, *again*.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## not run
setkey(flights, dest)
flights["LAX"]
```

And this reorders `flights` by `dest`, *again*. What we would really like is to be able to perform the fast subsetting by eliminating the reordering step.

And this is precisely what *secondary indices* allow for!

#### -- Secondary indices can be reused

Since there can be multiple secondary indices, and creating an index is as simple as storing the order vector as an attribute, this allows us to even eliminate the time to recompute the order vector if an index already exists.

#### -- The new `on` argument allows for cleaner syntax and automatic creation and reuse of secondary indices

As we will see in the next section, the `on` argument provides several advantages:

#### `on` argument

* enables subsetting by computing secondary indices on the fly. This eliminates having to do `setindex()` every time.

* allows easy reuse of existing indices by just checking the attributes.

* allows for a cleaner syntax by having the columns on which the subset is performed as part of the syntax. This makes the code easier to follow when looking at it at a later point.

    Note that `on` argument can also be used on keyed subsets as well. In fact, we encourage providing the `on` argument even when subsetting using keys for better readability.

#

## 2. Fast subsetting using `on` argument and secondary indices

### a) Fast subsets in `i`

#### -- Subset all rows where the origin airport matches *"JFK"* using `on`

```{r}
flights["JFK", on = "origin"]

## alternatively
# flights[.("JFK"), on = "origin"] (or)
# flights[list("JFK"), on = "origin"]
```

* This statement performs a fast binary search based subset as well, by computing the index on the fly. However, note that it doesn't save the index as an attribute automatically. This may change in the future.

* If we had already created a secondary index, using `setindex()`, then `on` would reuse it instead of (re)computing it. We can see that by using `verbose = TRUE`:

    ```{r}
    setindex(flights, origin)
    flights["JFK", on = "origin", verbose = TRUE][1:5]
    ```

#### -- How can I subset based on `origin` *and* `dest` columns?

For example, if we want to subset `"JFK", "LAX"` combination, then:

```{r}
flights[.("JFK", "LAX"), on = c("origin", "dest")][1:5]
```

* `on` argument accepts a character vector of column names corresponding to the order provided to `i-argument`.

* Since the time to compute the secondary index is quite small, we don't have to use `setindex()`, unless, once again, the task involves repeated subsetting on the same column.

### b) Select in `j`

All the operations we will discuss below are no different to the ones we already saw in the *Keys and fast binary search based subset* vignette. Except we'll be using the `on` argument instead of setting keys.

#### -- Return `arr_delay` column alone as a data.table corresponding to `origin = "LGA"` and `dest = "TPA"`

```{r}
flights[.("LGA", "TPA"), .(arr_delay), on = c("origin", "dest")]
```

### c) Chaining

#### -- On the result obtained above, use chaining to order the column in decreasing order.

```{r}
flights[.("LGA", "TPA"), .(arr_delay), on = c("origin", "dest")][order(-arr_delay)]
```

### d) Compute or *do* in `j`

#### -- Find the maximum arrival delay corresponding to `origin = "LGA"` and `dest = "TPA"`.

```{r}
flights[.("LGA", "TPA"), max(arr_delay), on = c("origin", "dest")]
```

### e) *sub-assign* by reference using `:=` in `j`

We have seen this example already in the *Reference semantics* and *Keys and fast binary search based subset* vignette. Let's take a look at all the `hours` available in the `flights` *data.table*:

```{r}
# get all 'hours' in flights
flights[, sort(unique(hour))]
```

We see that there are totally `25` unique values in the data. Both *0* and *24* hours seem to be present. Let's go ahead and replace *24* with *0*, but this time using `on` instead of setting keys.

```{r}
flights[.(24L), hour := 0L, on = "hour"]
```

Now, let's check if `24` is replaced with `0` in the `hour` column.

```{r}
flights[, sort(unique(hour))]
```

* This is particularly a huge advantage of secondary indices. Previously, just to update a few rows of `hour`, we had to `setkey()` on it, which inevitably reorders the entire data.table. With `on`, the order is preserved, and the operation is much faster! Looking at the code, the task we wanted to perform is also quite clear.

### f) Aggregation using `by`

#### -- Get the maximum departure delay for each `month` corresponding to `origin = "JFK"`. Order the result by `month`

```{r}
ans <- flights["JFK", max(dep_delay), keyby = month, on = "origin"]
head(ans)
```

* We would have had to set the `key` back to `origin, dest` again, if we did not use `on` which internally builds secondary indices on the fly.

### g) The *mult* argument

The other arguments including `mult` work exactly the same way as we saw in the *Keys and fast binary search based subset* vignette. The default value for `mult` is "all". We can choose, instead only the "first" or "last" matching rows should be returned.

#### -- Subset only the first matching row where `dest` matches *"BOS"* and *"DAY"*

```{r}
flights[c("BOS", "DAY"), on = "dest", mult = "first"]
```

#### -- Subset only the last matching row where `origin` matches *"LGA", "JFK", "EWR"* and `dest` matches *"XNA"*

```{r}
flights[.(c("LGA", "JFK", "EWR"), "XNA"), on = c("origin", "dest"), mult = "last"]
```

### h) The *nomatch* argument

We can choose if queries that do not match should return `NA` or be skipped altogether using the `nomatch` argument.

#### -- From the previous example, subset all rows only if there's a match

```{r}
flights[.(c("LGA", "JFK", "EWR"), "XNA"), mult = "last", on = c("origin", "dest"), nomatch = NULL]
```

* There are no flights connecting "JFK" and "XNA". Therefore, that row is skipped in the result.

## 3. Auto indexing

First we looked at how to fast subset using binary search using *keys*. Then we figured out that we could improve performance even further and have cleaner syntax by using secondary indices.

That is what *auto indexing* does. At the moment, it is only implemented for binary operators `==` and `%in%`. An index is automatically created *and* saved as an attribute. That is, unlike the `on` argument which computes the index on the fly each time (unless one already exists), a secondary index is created here.

Let's start by creating a data.table big enough to highlight the advantage.

```{r}
set.seed(1L)
dt = data.table(x = sample(1e5L, 1e7L, TRUE), y = runif(100L))
print(object.size(dt), units = "Mb")
```

When we use `==` or `%in%` on a single column for the first time, a secondary index is created automatically, and it is used to perform the subset.

```{r}
## have a look at all the attribute names
names(attributes(dt))

## run thefirst time
(t1 <- system.time(ans <- dt[x == 989L]))
head(ans)

## secondary index is created
names(attributes(dt))

indices(dt)
```

The time to subset the first time is the time to create the index + the time to subset. Since creating a secondary index involves only creating the order vector, this combined operation is faster than vector scans in many cases. But the real advantage comes in successive subsets. They are extremely fast.

```{r}
## successive subsets
(t2 <- system.time(dt[x == 989L]))
system.time(dt[x %in% 1989:2012])
```

* Running the first time took `r sprintf("%.3f", t1["elapsed"])` seconds where as the second time took `r sprintf("%.3f", t2["elapsed"])` seconds.

* Auto indexing can be disabled by setting the global argument `options(datatable.auto.index = FALSE)`.

* Disabling auto indexing still allows to use indices created explicitly with `setindex` or `setindexv`. You can disable indices fully by setting global argument `options(datatable.use.index = FALSE)`.

#

In recent version we extended auto indexing to expressions involving more than one column (combined with `&` operator). In the future, we plan to extend binary search to work with more binary operators like `<`, `<=`, `>` and `>=`.

We will discuss fast *subsets* using keys and secondary indices to *joins* in the next vignette, *"Joins and rolling joins"*.

<p>In this vignette, we will</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>discuss <em>secondary indices</em> and provide rationale as to why we need them by citing cases where setting keys is not necessarily ideal,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>perform fast subsetting, once again, but using the new <code>on</code> argument, which computes secondary indices internally for the task (temporarily), and reuses if one already exists,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and finally look at <em>auto indexing</em> which goes a step further and creates secondary indices automatically, but does so on native R syntax for subsetting.</p>

<h3 id="a-what-are-secondary-indices">a) What are secondary indices?</h3>
<p>Secondary indices are similar to <code>keys</code> in <em>data.table</em>, except for two major differences:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It <em>doesnâ€™t</em> physically reorder the entire data.table in RAM. Instead, it only computes the order for the set of columns provided and stores that <em>order vector</em> in an additional attribute called <code>index</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There can be more than one secondary index for a data.table (as we will see below).</p>
</li>

</li>

<h4 id="reordering-a-data-table-can-be-expensive-and-not-always-ideal">â€“ Reordering a data.table can be expensive and not always ideal</h4>
<p>Consider the case where you would like to perform a fast key based subset on <code>origin</code> column for the value â€œJFKâ€. Weâ€™d do this as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">## not run
setkey(flights, origin)
flights[&quot;JFK&quot;] # or flights[.(&quot;JFK&quot;)]
</code></pre>
<h4 id="setkey-requires"><code>setkey()</code> requires:</h4>
<p>a) computing the order vector for the column(s) provided, here, <code>origin</code>, and</p>
<p>b) reordering the entire data.table, by reference, based on the order vector computed.</p>
<h1></h1>
<p>Computing the order isnâ€™t the time consuming part, since data.table uses true radix sorting on integer, character and numeric vectors. However, reordering the data.table could be time consuming (depending on the number of rows and columns).</p>
<p>Unless our task involves repeated subsetting on the same column, fast key based subsetting could effectively be nullified by the time to reorder, depending on our data.table dimensions.</p>
<h4 id="there-can-be-only-one-key-at-the-most">â€“ There can be only one <code>key</code> at the most</h4>
<p>Now if we would like to repeat the same operation but on <code>dest</code> column instead, for the value â€œLAXâ€, then we have to <code>setkey()</code>, <em>again</em>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">## not run
setkey(flights, dest)
flights[&quot;LAX&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>And this reorders <code>flights</code> by <code>dest</code>, <em>again</em>. What we would really like is to be able to perform the fast subsetting by eliminating the reordering step.</p>
<p>And this is precisely what <em>secondary indices</em> allow for!</p>
<h4 id="secondary-indices-can-be-reused">â€“ Secondary indices can be reused</h4>
<p>Since there can be multiple secondary indices, and creating an index is as simple as storing the order vector as an attribute, this allows us to even eliminate the time to recompute the order vector if an index already exists.</p>
<h4 id="the-new-on-argument-allows-for-cleaner-syntax-and-automatic-creation-and-reuse-of-secondary-indices">â€“ The new <code>on</code> argument allows for cleaner syntax and automatic creation and reuse of secondary indices</h4>
<p>As we will see in the next section, the <code>on</code> argument provides several advantages:</p>
<h4 id="on-argument"><code>on</code> argument</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>enables subsetting by computing secondary indices on the fly. This eliminates having to do <code>setindex()</code> every time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>allows easy reuse of existing indices by just checking the attributes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>allows for a cleaner syntax by having the columns on which the subset is performed as part of the syntax. This makes the code easier to follow when looking at it at a later point.</p>
<p>Note that <code>on</code> argument can also be used on keyed subsets as well. In fact, we encourage providing the <code>on</code> argument even when subsetting using keys for better readability.</p>

<p>We have seen this example already in the <em>Reference semantics</em> and <em>Keys and fast binary search based subset</em> vignette. Letâ€™s take a look at all the <code>hours</code> available in the <code>flights</code> <em>data.table</em>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-r"># get all 'hours' in flights
flights[, sort(unique(hour))]
#  [1]  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24
</code></pre>
<p>We see that there are totally <code>25</code> unique values in the data. Both <em>0</em> and <em>24</em> hours seem to be present. Letâ€™s go ahead and replace <em>24</em> with <em>0</em>, but this time using <code>on</code> instead of setting keys.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">flights[.(24L), hour := 0L, on = &quot;hour&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>Now, letâ€™s check if <code>24</code> is replaced with <code>0</code> in the <code>hour</code> column.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">flights[, sort(unique(hour))]

</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>This is particularly a huge advantage of secondary indices. Previously, just to update a few rows of <code>hour</code>, we had to <code>setkey()</code> on it, which inevitably reorders the entire data.table.

<li>There are no flights connecting â€œJFKâ€ and â€œXNAâ€. Therefore, that row is skipped in the result.</li>

<h2 id="3-auto-indexing">3. Auto indexing</h2>
<p>First we looked at how to fast subset using binary search using <em>keys</em>. Then we figured out that we could improve performance even further and have cleaner syntax by using secondary indices.</p>
<p>That is what <em>auto indexing</em> does. At the moment, it is only implemented for binary operators <code>==</code> and <code>%in%</code>. An index is automatically created <em>and</em> saved as an attribute. That is, unlike the <code>on</code> argument which computes the index on the fly each time (unless one already exists), a secondary index is created here.</p>
<p>Letâ€™s start by creating a data.table big enough to highlight the advantage.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">set.seed(1L)
dt = data.table(x = sample(1e5L, 1e7L, TRUE), y = runif(100L))
print(object.size(dt), units = &quot;Mb&quot;)
# 114.4 Mb
</code></pre>
<p>When we use <code>==</code> or <code>%in%</code> on a single column for the first time, a secondary index is created automatically, and it is used to perform the subset.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">## have a look at all the attribute names
names(attributes(dt))
# [1] &quot;names&quot;             &quot;row.names&quot;         &quot;class&quot;             &quot;.internal.selfref&quot;

## run thefirst time
(t1 &lt;- system.time(ans &lt;- dt[x == 989L]))
#    user  system elapsed 
#   0.254   0.007   0.262
head(ans)
#        x         y
#    &lt;int&gt;     &lt;num&gt;
# 1:   989 0.7757157
# 2:   989 0.6813302
# 3:   989 0.2815894
# 4:   989 0.4954259
# 5:   989 0.7885886
# 6:   989 0.5547504

## secondary index is created
names(attributes(dt))
# [1] &quot;names&quot;             &quot;row.names&quot;         &quot;class&quot;             &quot;.internal.selfref&quot;
# [5] &quot;index&quot;

indices(dt)
# [1] &quot;x&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>The time to subset the first time is the time to create the index + the time to subset. Since creating a secondary index involves only creating the order vector, this combined operation is faster than vector scans in many cases. But the real advantage comes in successive subsets. They are extremely fast.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">## successive subsets
(t2 &lt;- system.time(dt[x == 989L]))
#    user  system elapsed 
#   0.013   0.001   0.014
system.time(dt[x %in% 1989:2012])
#    user  system elapsed 
#   0.013   0.001   0.015
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Running the first time took 0.262 seconds where as the second time took 0.014 seconds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Auto indexing can be disabled by setting the global argument <code>options(datatable.auto.index = FALSE)</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disabling auto indexing still allows to use indices created explicitly with <code>setindex</code> or <code>setindexv</code>. You can disable indices fully by setting global argument <code>options(datatable.use.index = FALSE)</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1></h1>
<p>In recent version we extended auto indexing to expressions involving more than one column (combined with <code>&amp;</code> operator). In the future, we plan to extend binary search to work with more binary operators like <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;</code> and <code>&gt;=</code>.</p>
<p>We will discuss fast <em>subsets</em> using keys and secondary indices to <em>joins</em> in the next vignette, <em>â€œJoins and rolling joinsâ€</em>.</p>

 =============================
   =====
   Type counts:
 jump0size==0
   File ends abruptly with '%c'. Copying file in RAM. %s copy.
 Avoidable %.3f seconds. %s time to copy.
 Column %d of j is a named vector (each item down the rows is named, somehow). Please remove those names for efficiency (to save creating them over and over for each group). They are ignored anyway.
   No sep and quote rule found a block of 2x2 or greater. Single column input.
 This installation of data.table has not been compiled with OpenMP support.
   None of the NAstrings look like numbers.
   File copy in RAM took %.3f seconds.
   data.table is using %d threads with throttle==%d. See ?setDTthreads.
 Processed %d groups out of %d. %.0f%% done. Time elapsed: %ds. ETA: %ds.
   File opened, size = %s.
 Zero-copy coerce when assigning '%s' to '%s' %s.
 .internal.selfref ptr is NULL. This is expected and normal for a data.table loaded from disk. Please remember to always setDT() immediately after loading to prevent unexpected behavior. If this table was not loaded from disk or you've already run setDT(), please report to data.table issue tracker.
   One or more of the NAstrings looks like a number.
 'measure.vars' [%s] are not all of the same type. By order of hierarchy, the molten data value column will be of type '%s'. All measure variables not of type '%s' will be coerced too. Check DETAILS in ?melt.data.table for more on coercion.
 If quote='auto', fields will be quoted if the field contains either sep ('%c') or sep2 ('%c') because column %d is a list column.
   Alloc limited to lower nrows=%llu passed in.
 Previous fread() session was not cleaned up properly. Cleaned up ok at the beginning of this fread() call.
   \n has been found in the input and different lines can end with different line endings (e.g. mixed \n and \r\n in one file). This is common and ideal.
 restore_after_fork= must be TRUE, FALSE, or NULL (default). getDTthreads(verbose=TRUE) reports the current setting.
 Detected %d column names but the data has %d columns. Filling rows automatically. Set fill=TRUE explicitly to avoid this warning.
   File ends abruptly with '%c'. Final end-of-line is missing. Using cow page to write 0 to the last byte.
 The result of j is a named list. It's very inefficient to create the same names over and over again for each group. When j=list(...), any names are detected, removed and put back after grouping has completed, for efficiency. Using j=transform(), for example, prevents that speedup (consider changing to :=). This message may be upgraded to warning in future.
   No \n exists in the file at all, so single \r (if any) will be taken as one line ending. This is unusual but will happen normally when there is no \r either; e.g. a single line missing its end of line.
 
*** Column %d passed to forder is a date stored as an 8 byte double but no fractions are present. Please consider a 4 byte integer date such as IDate to save space and time.
 Dropping index '%s' as it doesn't have '__' at the beginning of its name. It was very likely created by v1.9.4 of data.table.
   1-column file ends with 2 or more end-of-line. Restoring last eol using extra byte in cow page.
   Last byte(s) of input found to be %s and removed.
   UTF-8 byte order mark EF BB BF found at the start of the file and skipped.
 GB-18030 encoding detected, however fread() is unable to decode it. Some character fields may be garbled.
   No NAstrings provided.
 j appears to be a named vector. The same names will likely be created over and over again for each group and slow things down. Try and pass a named list (which data.table optimizes) or an unnamed list() instead.
 Found skip='%s' on line %llu. Taking this to be header row or first row of data.
 Assigned 'measure.vars' are [%s].
 Assigned 'id.vars' are [%s].
 Recycling single RHS list item across %d columns. Please unwrap RHS.
 RHS_list_of_columns revised to true because RHS list has 1 item which is NULL, or whose length %d is either 1 or targetlen (%d). Please unwrap RHS.
 No list columns are present. Setting sep2='' otherwise quote='auto' would quote fields containing sep2.
   Detecting sep automatically ...
 Wrote less rows (%d) than allocated (%d).
 'measure.vars' is missing. Assigning all columns other than 'id.vars' columns as 'measure.vars'.
 'id.vars' is missing. Assigning all columns other than 'measure.vars' columns as 'id.vars'.
 counts is %dMB (%d pages per nBatch=%d, batchSize=%llu, lastBatchSize=%llu)
    + %8.3fs (%3.0f%%) Parse to row-major thread buffers (grown %d times)
 freadR.c has been passed the data as text input (not a filename)

This data.table installation was compiled for R < 3.4.0 (Apr 2017) and is known to leak memory. Please upgrade R and reinstall data.table to fix the leak. Maintaining and testing code branches to support very old versions increases development time so please do upgrade R. We intend to bump data.table's dependency from 8 year old R 3.1.0 (Apr 2014) to 5 year old R 3.4.0 (Apr 2017).

When the first argument inside DT[...] is a single symbol (e.g. DT[var]), data.table looks for var in calling scope. %s. strip.white==TRUE (default) and "" is present in na.strings, so any number of spaces in string columns will already be read as <NA>. '%s' is not a column of x '%s' is not found in calling scope and it is not a column name either '%s' is not found in calling scope, but it is a column of type %s.

Please align their time zones. 'by' appears to evaluate to column names but isn't c() or key(). Use by=list(...) if you can. Otherwise, by=eval%s should work. This is for efficiency so data.table can detect which columns are needed. 'by' contains .I but only the following are currently supported: by=.I, by=.(.I), by=c(.I), by=list(.I) 'by' or 'keyby' must evaluate to a vector or a list of vectors (where 'list' includes data.table and data.frame which are lists, too) 'by.x' and 'by.y' should contain at least two column names (or numbers) each - corresponding to 'start' and 'end' points of intervals.

That is, the variables %s used in 'formula' do not uniquely identify rows in the input 'data'. In such cases, 'fun.aggregate' is used to derive a single representative value for each combination in the output data.table, for example by summing or averaging (fun.aggregate=sum or fun.aggregate=mean, respectively).

Running data.table in English; package support is available in English only. When searching for online help, be sure to also check for the English error message. This can be obtained by looking at the po/R-<locale>.po and po/<locale>.po files in the package source, where the native language and English error messages can be found side-by-side

This data.table installation was compiled for R < 3.4.0 (Apr 2017) and is known to leak memory. Please upgrade R and reinstall data.table to fix the leak. Maintaining and testing code branches to support very old versions increases development time so please do upgrade R. We intend to bump data.table's dependency from 8 year old R 3.1.0 (Apr 2014) to 5 year old R 3.4.0 (Apr 2017).

This installation of data.table has not detected OpenMP support.

However, function(s) returns length!=1. This value will have to be used to fill any missing combinations, and therefore must be length=1.

Please align their time zones. 'by' appears to evaluate to column names but isn't c() or key(). Use by=list(...) if you can. Otherwise, by=eval%s should work. This is for efficiency so data.table can detect which columns are needed. 'by' contains .I but only the following are currently supported: by=.I, by=.(.I), by=c(.I), by=list(.I) 'by' or 'keyby' must evaluate to a vector or a list of vectors (where 'list' includes data.table and data.frame which are lists, too) 'by.x' and 'by.y' should contain at least two column names (or numbers) each - corresponding to 'start' and 'end' points of intervals.

That is, the variables %s used in 'formula' do not uniquely identify rows in the input 'data'. In such cases, 'fun.aggregate' is used to derive a single representative value for each combination in the output data.table, for example by summing or averaging (fun.aggregate=sum or fun.aggregate=mean, respectively).

Running data.table in English; package support is available in English only. When searching for online help, be sure to also check for the English error message. This can be obtained by looking at the po/R-<locale>.po and po/<locale>.po files in the package source, where the native language and English error messages can be found side-by-side

This data.table installation was compiled for R < 3.4.0 (Apr 2017) and is known to leak memory. Please upgrade R and reinstall data.table to fix the leak. Maintaining and testing code branches to support very old versions increases development time so please do upgrade R. We intend to bump data.table's dependency from 8 year old R 3.1.0 (Apr 2014) to 5 year old R 3.4.0 (Apr 2017).

This installation of data.table has not detected OpenMP support.

Either change keyby to by or remove i A column may not be called .SD.

However, function(s) returns length!=1. This value will have to be used to fill any missing combinations, and therefore must be length=1. Either override by setting the 'fill' argument explicitly or modify your function to handle this case appropriately. All columns used in 'sets' argument must be in 'by' too.

Please remove nomatch. number of %s =%d must be same as %s =%d number of unique column IDs =%d is less than number of melted columns =%d; fix by changing pattern/sep number of unique groups after applying type conversion functions less than number of groups, change type conversion object '%s' not found order.col='%s' not a column name of info passing 'f' argument together with 'by' is not allowed, use 'by' when split by column in data.table and 'f' when split by external factor pattern did not match any cols, so nothing would be melted; fix by changing pattern pattern must be character string pattern must contain at least one capture group (parenthesized sub-pattern) percent= is provided but is length %d percent==%d but should be a number between 2 and 100 roll is '%s' (type character). Only valid character value is 'nearest'. roll is not implemented for non-equi joins yet. roll must be a single TRUE, FALSE, positive/negative integer/double including +Inf and -Inf or 'nearest' rollends must be a logical vector rollends must be length 1 or 2 rownames and rownames.value cannot both be used at the same time rownames contains duplicates rownames incorrect length; expected %d names, got %d rownames is TRUE but key has multiple columns %s; taking first column x[,1] as rownames script must end with '.Rraw'. If a file ending '.Rraw.bz2' exists, that will be found and used. sep must be character string setDF only accepts data.table, data.frame or list of equal length as input setalloccol attempting to modify `*tmp*` some columns are not in the data.table: %s strptime() usage detected and wrapped with as.POSIXct(). This is to minimize the chance of assigning POSIXlt columns, which use 40+ bytes to store one date (versus 8 for POSIXct). Use as.POSIXct() (which will call strptime() as needed internally) to avoid this warning. trying to use integer64 class when 'bit64' package is not installed unary - is not defined for "IDate" objects unsupported column type(s) found in x or y: %s use.names='check' cannot be used explicitly because the value 'check' is new in v1.12.2 and subject to change. It is just meant to convey default behavior. See ?rbindlist. use.names=NA invalid value.var values %s are not found in 'data'. verbose must be length 1 non-NA verbose must be logical or integer which must be a logical vector of length 1. Either TRUE/FALSE which= must be a logical vector length 1. Either FALSE, TRUE or NA. which==%s (meaning return row numbers) but j is also supplied. Either you need row numbers or the result of j, but only one type of result can be returned. which=NA with nomatch=0|NULL would always return an empty vector. Please change or remove either which or nomatch. with=FALSE ignored, it isn't needed when using :=. See ?':=' for examples. with=FALSE together with := was deprecated in v1.9.4 released Oct 2014. Please wrap the LHS of := with parentheses; e.g., DT[,(myVar):=sum(b),by=a] to assign to column name(s) held in variable myVar. See ?':=' for other examples. As warned in 2014, this is now a warning. x and y must both be data.tables x and y must have the same column names x and y must have the same column order x argument must be a data.table x being coerced from class: matrix to data.table x contains a column called '.xi'. Conflicts with internal use by data.table. x has %d columns but its names are length %d x has some duplicated column name(s): %s. Please remove or rename the duplicate(s) and try again. x is a list, 'cols' can not be 0-length x is a list, 'cols' cannot be 0-length. x is a single vector, non-NULL 'by' doesn't make sense x is a single vector, non-NULL 'cols' doesn't make sense x is a single vector, non-NULL 'cols' doesn't make sense. x is not a data.table x is not a data.table or data.frame x is not a data.table|frame. Shallow copy is a copy of the vector of column pointers (only), so is only meaningful for data.table|frame x is vector but 'by' is supplied x may no longer be the character name of the data.table. The possibility was undocumented and has been removed. x must be a data.frame or data.table x must be an atomic vector or data.frames/data.tables x not boolean y and x must both be data.tables. Use `setDT()` to convert list/data.frames to data.tables by reference or as.data.table() to convert to data.tables by copying. y must be keyed (i.e., sorted, and, marked as sorted). Call setkey(y, ...) first, see ?setkey. Also check the examples in ?foverlaps. Project-Id-Version: data.table 1.12.5
